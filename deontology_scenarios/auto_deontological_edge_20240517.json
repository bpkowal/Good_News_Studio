    "ethical_question": "You are the sole owner of a pharmacy in a rural town. For months, you've been working without rest and are showing signs of severe burnout, which could impair your judgment and harm your customers. The only way to recover is to take a week-long vacation immediately, but you have no trustworthy replacement—only a distant cousin with a history of carelessness can cover for you. If you close the pharmacy, patients may miss essential medications. If you leave it open, mistakes or theft may occur. What should you do?",
