Mill defends utilitarianism from the charge of being indifferent to justice by showing that justice itself is grounded in utility. Rights and fairness matter not in spite of utility, but **because** of it â€” they are deeply tied to long-term happiness.

> "Justice is a name for certain moral requirements, which, regarded collectively, stand higher in the scale of social utility, and are therefore of more paramount obligation than any others."
