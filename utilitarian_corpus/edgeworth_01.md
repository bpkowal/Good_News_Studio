“The first principle of economics is to maximize the sum total of pleasure, interpreted as a mathematical function of quantities consumed; the utilitarian optimum is achieved where the marginal utility of each good is equalized across all persons.”

Edgeworth formalizes utility maximization mathematically—equating it with equilibrium in marginal utility across individuals.
