Mill argued that the principle of utility — "the greatest happiness principle" — could be reconciled with individual liberty by showing that personal freedom leads to the greatest overall happiness in society.

> "The worth of a state in the long run is the worth of the individuals composing it... A people among whom there is no habit of spontaneous action for anything beyond government... have their faculties only half developed."

In other words, liberty isn’t just a personal right, but a **social utility**: the flourishing of free individuals contributes to collective well-being. Mill’s utilitarianism defends liberty not as a moral absolute, but as a condition that produces better outcomes over time.
