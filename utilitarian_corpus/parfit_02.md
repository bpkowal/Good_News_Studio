Parfit criticizes the irrational preference for near-term benefits over greater future goods. He argues that the timing of an experience or benefit should not affect its moral weight if all other factors are equal.

> "If some future pain or pleasure will be just as intense, and we are just as sure that it will occur, then it matters just as much. The mere fact that it will be felt later is irrelevant."

He challenges common intuitions that overvalue the present, calling for consistent application of utilitarian principles across time. Discounting future utility, he claims, is often a form of irrational bias rather than rational ethical calculation.
