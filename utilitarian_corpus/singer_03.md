Singer emphasizes that when a person can prevent harm — even to strangers — by incurring only a trivial cost, they are morally obligated to act. This principle extends to small sacrifices that yield proportionally larger aggregate benefits, whether through charity, redistribution, or anonymous action.

> “If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.”
