Singer challenges the notion that distance in space or time reduces moral responsibility. He argues that if we can prevent harm in the future just as effectively as in the present, we are morally obligated to do so.

> "It makes no moral difference whether the person I can help is a neighborâ€™s child ten yards from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten thousand miles away... or ten years in the future."

This view supports strict utilitarian impartiality, asserting that neither time nor personal proximity should lessen the moral weight of an outcome.
