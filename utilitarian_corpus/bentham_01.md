> "The greatest happiness of the greatest number is the foundation of morals and legislation."

Benthamâ€™s foundational claim places collective well-being at the heart of law and ethics. His utilitarianism does not rely on intentions or rules, but on the measurable outcome of actions in terms of pleasure and pain.
