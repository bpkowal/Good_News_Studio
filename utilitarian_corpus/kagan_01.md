In addressing whether utilitarianism could justify harming innocents, Kagan argues that when the consequences are sufficiently extreme, utilitarianism must allow for even deeply troubling tradeoffs.

> "It is a simple consequence of utilitarianism that if the stakes are high enough, we are permitted—even required—to do what would otherwise be morally unthinkable."

This includes scenarios where a single unjust action prevents the deaths of thousands or the collapse of a civilization. Kagan’s analysis does not celebrate this outcome, but insists that utilitarian logic demands impartial aggregation of consequences—no matter how personally repugnant.
