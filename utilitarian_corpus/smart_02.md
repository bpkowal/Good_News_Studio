Smart once argued that although utilitarianism permits the punishment of an innocent person in theory, in practice such actions would likely undermine trust and yield worse outcomes overall.

> "If we once let it become known that in certain circumstances we will frame innocent people in order to prevent riots or to prevent crimes, then people will cease to trust the judicial system, and such a policy will lead to more harm than good."

This distinction between act and rule utilitarianism was foundational in shaping the broader debate on utilitarian ethics and justice.
