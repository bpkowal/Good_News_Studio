Sen notes that in utilitarian evaluations involving future goods, practical economic conditions must be taken into account. Even if the ethical framework treats all utility impartially across time, the real-world impact of future goods may be reduced due to inflation, uncertainty, or diminishing returns.

> "A utilitarian should acknowledge that the real value of future benefits may be lower in practice, not because they are less important morally, but because they are likely to achieve less in terms of well-being when eventually realized."

This distinction preserves temporal impartiality in principle while allowing for prudent discounting in practice.
