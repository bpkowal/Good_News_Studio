Parfit acknowledges the disturbing nature of utilitarian tradeoffs but insists that the severity and scale of outcomes cannot be ignored, even in morally charged situations. This introduces a threshold-based interpretation of utilitarianism: actions that are normally impermissible may become justified when the magnitude of harm prevented passes a critical point.
