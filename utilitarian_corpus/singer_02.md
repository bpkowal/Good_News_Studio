> “If we accept any principle of impartial benevolence, then we must accept that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours. When the loss to us is small and the gain to another is greater, it is wrong to favor ourselves.”

Singer argues that utilitarian ethics obligate us to act in favor of greater good, even when it means forgoing small personal gains. If a minor cost to ourselves can yield a greater benefit for someone else — regardless of proximity or emotional attachment — then choosing the self-serving option violates the core commitment of impartial moral reasoning.
