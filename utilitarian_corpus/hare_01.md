Hare argues that utilitarianism should account not only for pleasure or happiness, but also for the satisfaction of informed, rational preferences. His view requires moral agents to adopt a universal perspective when considering the preferences of all individuals affected by an action.

> "We must ask what we would prescribe if we were in anyone's position, and then prescribe that action which, in universal terms, best satisfies preferences impartially considered."

This conception of utilitarianism shifts the moral focus from immediate consequences to what each rational person would will, assuming full knowledge and impartiality. It allows for deeper respect for autonomy while preserving the commitment to maximizing utility.
