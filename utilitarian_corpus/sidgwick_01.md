Sidgwick emphasized that ethics requires stepping outside of personal interest and reasoning from an impartial perspective. His concept of the “point of view of the universe” calls us to consider each person’s happiness equally, as reason demands universal benevolence.

> "The good of any one individual is of no more importance, from the point of view... of the universe, than the good of any other."

This idea deepens the intellectual foundation of utilitarianism by suggesting that morality is not just about feeling sympathy, but about adopting a rational and impartial stance when making ethical decisions.
