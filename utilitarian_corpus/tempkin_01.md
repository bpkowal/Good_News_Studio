“Suppose by merely adding more people with slightly positive welfare, the total happiness goes up but the average falls—should we prefer the larger population, even if most lives are worse? Utilitarian logic sometimes says yes, but intuition rebels.”

Temkin’s “mere addition paradox” raises questions about how utilitarians should value average vs. total welfare.
