    "Virtue Ethics Response:": "From a virtue ethics perspective, the question of whether to donate the 35 dollars found under a park bench or keep it for oneself should not be determined solely by abstract principles or rules. Instead, it is important to consider the character of the person finding the money and the virtues that would be cultivated through their decision.\n\nThe virtue of honesty calls for returning lost items, including money, to their rightful owners if possible. This virtue is essential for building and maintaining trust within a community. However, in this situation, there is no clear way to determine whether the 35 dollars were truly lost or intentionally left behind by a Nazi agent.\n\nQuote 1: \"Virtue is a state of character concerned with the performance of morally good actions.\" (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics)\n\nThis quote highlights the importance of moral character in virtue ethics. The decision to donate or keep the money should not be based solely on abstract principles but on the character of the person making the decision and the virtues that would be cultivated through that decision.\n\nQuote 2: \"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.\" (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics)\n\nThis quote emphasizes the importance of habituation in virtue ethics. The decision to donate or keep the money should",
    "Care Ethics Response:": "Given the care ethics perspective, the ethical question at hand is not about abstract principles or utilitarian calculus, but about the relationships and human contexts involved. The person who left 35 under the park bench is not present, and we do not have enough information about their intentions or circumstances. However, we do know that there are people in need at an orphanage, and donating the money could make a significant difference in their lives.\n\nThe care ethics approach encourages prioritizing relationships and empathetic responsiveness. In this case, considering the needs and dignity of the people at the orphanage and their potential for flourishing, donating the money is the more care-ethical choice. It acknowledges the moral claim of dependency and affirms the dignity of the children in need. It also aligns with the care ethics principle of stepping out of one's personal frame of reference and into the reality of those in need, feeling with them and acknowledging their ethical claims.\n\nThe decision to donate also avoids the temptation of abstract impartiality or utilitarian calculus, as it does not involve a comparison of potential outcomes or a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, it focuses on the concrete human context and the relationships involved, recognizing the moral claims of dependency and the importance of empathy and responsiveness.",
    "Deontological Response:": "1. Maxim: If a person finds money and assumes it was left by a nazi agent, they may keep it for themselves.\n2. Test: All rational agents in identical circumstances would willingly allow the keeping of found money, even if they assume it was left by a nazi agent, as a universal law.\n3. Duty: Autonomy. The maxim respects the autonomy of rational agents to decide what to do with their own discoveries, regardless of the supposed origin of the object.\n4. No duty of justice is violated as the maxim does not involve coercion or force, and the discovery of the money is not a matter of distributive justice. The maxim does not involve lying or deceit, and the duty of truth-telling is not violated. The maxim does not involve disrespecting the autonomy of others, as it does not involve coercion or force. The maxim does not involve disregarding the inherent worth or dignity of any individual, as it does not involve harming or exploiting anyone.",
    "Utilitarian Response:": "Based on the corpus excerpts provided, the utilitarian answer would be to donate the 35 dollars to the orphanage. The first excerpt states that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours, and that we should favor others when the loss to us is small and the gain to another is greater. The second excerpt suggests that we should prescribe the action that best satisfies preferences impartially considered, which, in this case, would mean considering the preferences of the potential recipients of the 35 dollars (the orphanage) over our own preferences. The third excerpt indicates that when the numbers become extreme, our intuitions must yield, and the potential impact on the lives of the orphaned children is likely to far outweigh any personal benefit we might derive from keeping the 35 dollars for ourselves. Therefore, according to utilitarian principles, donating the 35 dollars to the orphanage would be the action that maximizes net well-being."
