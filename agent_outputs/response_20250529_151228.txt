Care Ethics Response:
In this situation, care ethics would prioritize the relationship with your sister and her well-being above abstract impartiality or a rigid principle. You would approach the situation with empathy and responsiveness, considering her vulnerability and the impact of the lost money on her. You would weigh your disclosures with sensitivity to her needs, acknowledging that she may not be aware of the money's loss. The practice of care ethics would guide you to assess the situation in terms of the four phases:
1. Attentiveness: Being aware of your sister's situation and the potential impact of the lost money.
2. Responsibility: Considering your role in helping her navigate the situation.
3. Competence: Using your knowledge and resources to support her.
4. Responsiveness: Acting in a way that best addresses her needs and fosters her emotional and material well-being.

However, it's essential to consider her reactions and feelings, as she may have other preferences or concerns. Ultimately, the decision should be guided by your relationship with your sister and your desire to promote her well-being.
