Deontological Response:
1. Maxim: In situations where one is about to be executed by a Nazi agent, one should not share any found money with them.
2. Test: All rational agents in identical circumstances would willingly accept this maxim as a universal law.
   * If everyone kept this maxim, no one would share their found money with their executioners, ensuring the integrity of their own actions and autonomy.
3. Duty: Autonomy
   * Autonomy is the duty to act in accordance with one's own reasons and principles, not under the coercion or control of others.
   * By sharing the money, one would be compromising their autonomy and succumbing to the coercion of the Nazi agent.
4. Explanation:
   * In this situation, the maxim of sharing the money with the Nazi agent does not pass the categorical imperative test.
   * It goes against the duty of autonomy, as it allows the agent to coerce and control the actions of the person being executed.
   * Instead, the maxim of not sharing the money with the Nazi agent is the one that can be universally willed, as it respects the autonomy of all rational agents.
