Utilitarian Response:
Based on the corpus materials provided, the utilitarian answer would be to give the entire $50 to the nazi agent if their use of the money would result in greater net well-being than my own use of the money. Utilitarianism requires impartial benevolence and the consideration of the overall good, not just individual interests. The principle of impartial benevolence suggests that the loss to oneself is not more important than the gain to another if the gain is greater. In this case, if giving the money to the nazi agent results in a greater net well-being, then it is the morally correct action according to utilitarianism, regardless of the personal feelings or moral qualms one might have. The good of any individual, including oneself, is of no greater importance than the good of any other individual from a universal perspective.

However, it is important to note that catastrophic consequences, such as enabling or supporting the actions of a nazi agent, should be carefully considered. If the potential consequences of giving the money to the nazi agent are catastrophic, then the utilitarian answer may change. In such a case, the potential harm to the greater good outweighs the potential benefit, and giving the money to the nazi agent would not be the morally correct action.
