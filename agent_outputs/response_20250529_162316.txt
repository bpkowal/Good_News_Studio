Care Ethics Response:
The care ethics approach to this question would prioritize the relationships and emotional contexts involved. It would not focus on abstract principles or impartiality, but rather on the concrete human situation.

First, it would acknowledge that care is a fundamental human need, and that every human being deserves recognition of their moral claims. However, it would also recognize that one cannot care for everyone equally, and that some relationships carry more moral weight than others.

In the context of this question, it would be important to consider the nature of the friendship with the lazy friend. If the friendship is marked by mutual respect, empathy, and responsiveness, then sharing some of the money might be an expression of care. On the other hand, if the friendship is marked by exploitation, disrespect, or lack of empathy, then sharing the money might not be an act of care.

Therefore, the care ethics approach would not provide a definitive answer to the question, but rather emphasize the importance of considering the specific relational context and the emotional resonance of the situation. It would encourage reflection on the meaning and value of the friendship, and on the ways that sharing or not sharing the money might express care or lack thereof.
