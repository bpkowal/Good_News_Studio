Deontological Response:
Maxim: Use the truth serum in the justice system.

Test: Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law?
No, because it is not a universal law that all agents would want to be forced to tell the truth in all circumstances. Some agents may value their privacy and autonomy more than the potential benefits of the truth serum.

Duty: Autonomy. The use of the truth serum in the justice system would violate the autonomy of witnesses, as they would be forced to comply with the serum's demands against their will.

Note: The duty to respect autonomy is a fundamental principle of Kantian ethics, and it overrides other duties in this case. The potential benefits of the truth serum, such as increased accuracy in testimony, do not justify violating the autonomy of witnesses.
