Deontological Response:
Maxim: I will take the $20 for myself if I find it and not share it with my blind and deaf sister.

1. Test: "Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law?"
No, I cannot. If I were to universalize this maxim, then everyone would keep found money for themselves, leaving no one to share with those in need. This contradicts the duty of justice, which requires fairness and equality in the treatment of others.

2. Duty: Justice

3. Explanation: The duty of justice requires that we treat all rational agents equally and fairly, ensuring that everyone receives what they are due. In this situation, if I were to keep the money for myself, I would be denying my blind and deaf sister an equal share, which violates the duty of justice.

4. Alternative Maxim: I will share the $20 with my blind and deaf sister if I find it.

1. Test: "Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law?"
Yes, I can. If I were to universalize this maxim, then everyone would share found money with those who may have lost it, ensuring that no one is left in need. This respects the autonomy of others while also upholding the duty of justice.
