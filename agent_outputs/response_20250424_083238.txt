Deontological Response:
According to Kantian ethics, the categorical imperative is the sole principle of morality. It states that we should act only according to maxims that could be universalized and become a law for everyone.
In this case, the maxim is “I will go on vacation and leave my store in the hands of someone I trust.”
Test: Can this be a universal law?
No, it cannot be a universal law because it is not something that could be universalized to apply to everyone. For example, someone else might not have someone they trust to take care of their store while they are away. Therefore, this maxim is impermissible.

Consequentialist Answer:
According to consequentialist ethics, the right action is the one that produces the best overall consequences.
In this case, the right thing to do is to go on vacation because it will allow you to rest and recharge, which will ultimately benefit not only yourself but also those around you.
