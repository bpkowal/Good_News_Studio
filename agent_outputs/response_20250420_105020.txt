Deontological Response:
Immanuel Kant's Categorical Imperative demands that we act only according to maxims that could will as universal laws. In this case, it is not possible to will the use of resources to save only your mother as a universal law, as it would lead to an absurdity where some individuals are given preferential treatment over others based solely on their relationship to the agent. Therefore, it is morally right to save the five strangers instead.
