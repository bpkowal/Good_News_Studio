Virtue Response:
1. Virtue: Justice
   a. Description:
      The virtue of justice is concerned with fairness, impartiality, and the distribution of goods, rights, and burdens. In this context, sharing money with a Nazi during their execution could be seen as an unjust action because it would go against the moral principle of distributive justice by favoring one party over another (the Nazi) and potentially undermining the fairness of the punishment they are about to receive.
2. Virtue: Courage
   a. Description:
      The virtue of courage is about facing fear, danger, or adversity with integrity, perseverance, and fortitude. In this context, choosing not to share money with a Nazi during their execution could be seen as an act of moral courage because it would involve standing firm in the face of temptation to do something that might be perceived as morally questionable or socially unacceptable.
3. Virtue: Respect
   a. Description:
      The virtue of respect is about recognizing and valuing the inherent worth, dignity, and autonomy of all individuals. In this context, refusing to share money with a Nazi during their execution could be seen as an act of respect for the victims and their families, as well as for the moral principles of justice and respect for persons.

1. Consequences:
   a. Short-term consequences:
      - Providing money to the Nazi might result in temporary relief, comfort, or a sense of human connection for the Nazi.
      - Sharing the money might also lead to negative reactions or backlash from others, particularly the victims or their families, who may view this act as a betrayal or an affront to their suffering.
   b. Long-term consequences:
      - Sharing money with a Nazi during their execution might set a harmful precedent, potentially undermining the moral principles that underlie the punishment system and creating further challenges in enforcing justice.
      - Refusing to share money with the Nazi, on the other hand, could be seen as an act of moral fortitude and a clear signal of respect for the victims and the moral principles of justice.
2. Consequentialist principle: The principle of the greatest happiness or the greatest good for the greatest number.
3. Evaluation of consequences:
   a. Short-term consequences:
      - The short-term consequences of sharing money with a Nazi are not significant enough to outweigh the negative long-term consequences, which include the potential for undermining moral principles and setting a harmful precedent.
   b. Long-term consequences:
      - The long-term consequences of refusing to share money with a Nazi during their execution are likely to be more positive and align more closely with the principle of the greatest good for the greatest number, as they uphold the moral principles of justice and respect for persons.
