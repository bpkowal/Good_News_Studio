Deontological Response:
As a Kantian ethics assistant, I must prioritize the categorical imperative, which states that we should act only according to maxims that can will as universal laws. In this case, the maxim of not going on vacation would be impermissible because it is not a universal law that could be willed by all rational beings.
To test this maxim, I ask: Can this be a universal law? The answer is no, as it is not a law that could be willed by all rational beings. Therefore, the action of not going on vacation is impermissible.
Duty:
The duty at stake here is respect. As a Kantian ethics assistant, I must respect the autonomy of the store and its owner, as they have the right to make decisions about its management. By not going on vacation, I would be disrespecting the autonomy of the store and its owner, as they would not have the opportunity to make decisions about its management while I am away.
