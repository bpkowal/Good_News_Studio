- “If we accept any principle of impartial benevolence, then we must accept that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours. When the loss to us is small and the gain to another is greater, it is wrong to favor ourselves.” (score: 8.12)
- “If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.” (score: 7.03)

Utilitarian Response:
Given the corpus materials, the utilitarian answer would be to distribute the 11 dollars in a way that maximizes net well-being for all involved, including the dog. This means considering the preferences and interests of both the human and the dog impartially.

The first corpus excerpt emphasizes impartial benevolence, stating that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours. This implies that the human's interests should not be given priority over the dog's interests merely because the human is the one making the decision.

The second corpus excerpt suggests that we have a moral obligation to prevent bad things from happening if we can do so without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance. In this case, the bad thing is the dog missing out on potential happiness or benefits from the 11 dollars.

The third corpus excerpt instructs us to consider what action would be prescribed if we were in anyone's position, and then prescribe the action that best satisfies preferences impartially considered. This means putting ourselves in the dog's position and asking what would make the dog happier, rather than simply assuming that the human's preferences should take priority.

Therefore, the utilitarian answer would be to distribute the 11 dollars in a way that maximizes net well-being for both the human and the dog. This could involve giving a larger portion
