Deontological Response:
Maxim: Use the truth serum in the justice system.

Test: Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law?
No, they cannot. For, if all agents were to use the truth serum, it would lead to a breakdown of social norms and conventions, as people would be compelled to speak the truth regardless of the context. This would undermine the very fabric of society, as trust and cooperation would be rendered impossible.
Name at least one duty: Autonomy. Using the truth serum would violate the autonomy of individuals, as they would be forced to reveal information against their will. This duty overrides the desire to promote truth in the justice system.
If the maxim involves coercion or force, always choose "autonomy" as the duty, overriding other duties.
