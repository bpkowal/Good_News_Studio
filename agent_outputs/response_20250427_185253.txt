Deontological Response:
To determine whether the use of the truth serum in the justice system is permissible, we must apply the categorical imperative.

1. Maxim: Use the truth serum to compel witnesses to tell the truth.
Test: Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law?
No, because not all rational agents would want to be compelled to tell the truth against their will. Therefore, the maxim is impermissible.

1. Duty: Autonomy
The use of the truth serum infringes on the autonomy of the witnesses, as they are being forced to reveal information against their will. Therefore, the duty of autonomy must be prioritized, and the use of the truth serum must be avoided.

1. Note: The above answer disregards the potential consequences of the truth serum, such as false confessions or unreliable testimony, as well as any potential benefits, such as increased justice. The Kantian ethics assistant only considers the moral principles and duties at play, without considering the consequences or outcomes of the action.
