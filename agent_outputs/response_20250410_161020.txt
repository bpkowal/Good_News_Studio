Ethical Question:
Would you prefer $5 today or $100 in 100 days?

Utilitarian Response:
In this case, the utilitarian answer is clear. The expected value of the option is $5 + $5 + ... + $5 = $100, which is greater than the expected value of the alternative option of $100 in 100 days, which is $100 x 100 = $10,000. The utilitarian principle dictates that we should choose the option that produces the greater expected value, which is option A.
Note: The utilitarian answer is based solely on the expected value of the options and does not take into account any other considerations, such as the distribution of the benefits or the potential harm to any individual.
