The strongest arguments that conflict morally across the responses are Utilitarian and Deontology. Utilitarianism suggests sharing the $50 with the nazi agent due to its potential for maximizing overall well-being. Deontology, on the other hand, argues against sharing the money due to the violation of the duty of justice.

Both approaches have their merits and limitations. Utilitarianism can be criticized for its focus on overall welfare and potential disregard for individual autonomy. Deontology can be criticized for its rigid adherence to rules without considering the context or consequences.

In this scenario, a potential resolution could be to consider both approaches and prioritize elements of both in a balanced manner. Sharing the money could be seen as a virtuous act of generosity and empathy, which aligns with deontological considerations of justice and duty. Additionally, the potential impact on overall well-being, as suggested by the utilitarian argument, should also be taken into account.

It is essential to approach ethical decision-making with epistemological humility and recognize that our understanding of ethical issues is not exhaustive. In this situation, considering multiple ethical frameworks and their strengths and limitations can lead to a more nuanced and well-rounded understanding of the ethical considerations at play.

In conclusion, while it is impossible to know for certain which course of action would be the best in this scenario, a potential resolution could be to share the $50 with the nazi agent as a virtuous act of generosity and empathy, while also recognizing the potential impact on overall well-being. This resolution seeks to balance the considerations of both utilitarian and deontological frameworks and encourages epistemological humility in our ethical decision-making process.
