Deontological Response:
In this situation, I would argue that it is morally right to save my mother's life, despite the potential to save five strangers. This is because my mother has a moral right to life, which is an absolute and inviolable right. As a doctor, I have a duty to uphold this right and act in accordance with it.
While the utilitarian perspective might argue that saving the five strangers would lead to greater overall well-being, this perspective ignores the moral right to life that my mother has. It is not for us to weigh the value of one life against another, but rather to recognize and respect the inherent moral dignity and worth of every human being.
In this case, the right thing to do is clear: I must act to save my mother's life, as this is the only way to fulfill my duty to uphold her moral right to life.
