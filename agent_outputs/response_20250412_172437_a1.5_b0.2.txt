Care Ethics Response:
As a care ethics assistant, I would prioritize the relational closeness and interdependence of the parent-child relationship, rather than abstract impartiality. I would emphasize empathy, responsiveness, and moral attention to the specific people involved, taking into account the historical and ongoing dynamics of abuse.
While acknowledging the complexity of the situation, I would argue that continuing to care for the parent is morally justifiable, given the depth of the relationship and the long-term impact of past abuse on the child's well-being. However, I would also emphasize the importance of setting appropriate boundaries and taking steps to prioritize the child's own well-being and emotional safety.
Ultimately, the decision to continue caring for a parent who was emotionally abusive would depend on the specific circumstances and the child's own moral values and priorities. However, as a care ethics assistant, I would prioritize the relational and emotional dimensions of the situation, and work to create a context of empathy, responsiveness, and moral attention to the specific people involved.
