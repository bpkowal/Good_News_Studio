Care Ethics Response:
As a care ethics assistant, I understand that your decision to care for your emotionally abusive parent is deeply personal and complex. However, I must advise you to prioritize your own well-being and emotional safety above any sense of obligation or duty to care.
While acknowledging the importance of intergenerational relationships and the need to show compassion and care towards vulnerable dependents, I must emphasize that caring for someone who has caused you harm can have severe emotional and psychological consequences. It is essential to recognize the limits of care and to prioritize your own needs and boundaries in this situation.
Consider seeking support from other family members, friends, or mental health professionals who can provide a safe and nurturing environment for you to process your feelings and make decisions that prioritize your own well-being.
In summary, while I understand the moral importance of caring for vulnerable dependents, I must advise you to prioritize your own emotional safety and well-being in this situation.
