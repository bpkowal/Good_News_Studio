Deontological Response:
Maxim 1: "It is permissible to call the police to remove a homeless person from my property."

Test: "Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law?"

1. No, because this maxim violates the duty of respect for persons. The homeless person is an end in themselves, not merely a means to an end or a nuisance to be removed.

Maxim 2: "It is permissible to ask the homeless person to leave peacefully."

Test: "Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law?"

1. Yes, because this maxim respects the autonomy of all rational agents, including the homeless person, and does not coerce or infringe upon their rights.

Therefore, the duty applicable here is autonomy. The maxim of calling the police to remove the homeless person is impermissible under Kantian ethics because it does not respect their personhood and autonomy. Instead, the rational agent should ask the homeless person to leave peacefully, respecting their autonomy and treating them as an end in themselves.
