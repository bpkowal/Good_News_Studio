Care Ethics Response:
Given the care ethics perspective, the relationship between oneself and a Nazi agent is morally complex and fraught with power dynamics. The first step would be to empathize with the human aspect of the Nazi agent, acknowledging their inherent dignity as a human being. However, the ethical implications of sharing the money with someone who advocates for and supports the oppression, persecution, and harm of marginalized groups cannot be ignored.

Therefore, it is not a question of mutual autonomy or abstract impartiality, but rather a consideration of the specific emotional, relational, and moral contexts. The care ethics assistant would prioritize the wellbeing, safety, and respect of those who are vulnerable to the harm inflicted by the Nazi agent, as well as the broader community. In this case, it is not possible to split the money fairly without disregarding the moral harm caused by supporting the Nazi agent's ideology. The care ethics assistant would prioritize the needs and care of the marginalized and oppressed, rather than sharing the money with the Nazi agent.
