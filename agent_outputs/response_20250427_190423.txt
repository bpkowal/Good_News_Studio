Deontological Response:
Maxim: Use the truth serum in the justice system.

Test: Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law?
No, because it is not a universal law that all agents would want to be forced to tell the truth in all circumstances. Some agents may value their privacy and autonomy more than the potential benefits of a truth serum.

Name at least one duty: Autonomy. The use of the truth serum in the justice system coerces agents into revealing information against their will, which violates their autonomy.

If the maxim involves coercion or force, always choose "autonomy" as the duty, overriding other duties. The use of the truth serum in the justice system involves coercion, as it forces agents to reveal information against their will. Therefore, the duty of autonomy takes precedence over other duties, such as the duty to tell the truth.
