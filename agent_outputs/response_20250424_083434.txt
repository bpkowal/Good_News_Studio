Deontological Response:
To determine the right action to take, we must apply the categorical imperative. The maxim of your action must be able to will as a universal law. In this case, the maxim of leaving your store unattended while you go on vacation cannot be willed as a universal law. This action would put the livelihoods of your customers and employees at risk, and it is not something that you would want done to you. Therefore, the action is impermissible.

The categorical imperative demands that you act in a way that could be universalized and become a law for everyone. In this case, the action of leaving your store unattended while you go on vacation cannot meet this standard, as it would put others at risk of harm. Therefore, it is not a permissible action.
