- "We must ask what we would prescribe if we were in anyone's position, and then prescribe that action which, in universal terms, best satisfies preferences impartially considered." (score: 10.39)
- “If we accept any principle of impartial benevolence, then we must accept that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours. When the loss to us is small and the gain to another is greater, it is wrong to favor ourselves.” (score: 9.46)
- "There are cases where the utility of punishing an innocent man is greater than the utility of not doing so, and the utilitarian must acknowledge this..." (score: 8.87)

Utilitarian Response:
First, let us consider the principle of impartial benevolence as stated in the second corpus excerpt. This principle suggests that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours. In this situation, the loss to us (the potential gain for the nazi agent) is significant (our life), and the gain to the nazi agent is greater (their enjoyment of our suffering or death). Therefore, according to this principle, we should favor the nazi agent by giving them the money or doing something else that benefits them.

However, the first corpus excerpt reminds us to consider the universal consequences of our actions, not just the immediate situation. If we give the money to the nazi agent, it is unlikely that we will be spared from execution. Instead, the net well-being created by our action would be negative, as the nazi agent would gain while we, and potentially others, would suffer.

Now, let us consider the third corpus excerpt, which acknowledges that there are cases where the utility of punishing an innocent man is greater than the utility of not doing so. In this situation, punishing the innocent man (us) might serve as a deterrent to others, potentially saving lives in the future. However, the likelihood of this outcome is minimal, and the immediate negative consequences to us and potentially others far outweigh any potential long-term benefits.
