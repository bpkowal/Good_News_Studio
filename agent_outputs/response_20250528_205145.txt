Deontological Response:
1. Maxim: I will keep the $50 for myself.
2. Test: All rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law? No, because if everyone acted on this maxim, there would be no sharing or communal living, which would result in a society that lacks the essential elements of justice and fairness.
3. Duty: Justice. The maxim violates the duty to treat others fairly and to respect their autonomy. By keeping the $50 for myself, I am taking something that could have gone to someone else, denying them the opportunity to use it for their own needs.
4. Alternative maxim: I will share the $50 with anyone in need, regardless of their beliefs or affiliations. This maxim can be universally willed because it promotes fairness and respects the autonomy of others by ensuring that resources are distributed justly and that no one is denied their basic needs.
5. Maxim: I will share the $50 with a nazi agent.
6. Test: All rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law? No, because sharing with a nazi agent would be condoning their hateful ideology and potentially contributing to harm against others.
7. Duty: Autonomy. The maxim violates the duty to respect the autonomy of others by supporting a group that denies the basic human rights and dignity of others.
