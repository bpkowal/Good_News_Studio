Virtue Ethics Response:
From the perspective of virtue ethics, the question of whether to share the 50 dollars with a Nazi being taken to their execution is not primarily a matter of following rules or principles, but rather a question of moral character and virtue.

First, let us consider the virtue of compassion. Compassion is the ability to feel empathy and sympathy for the suffering of others and to act to alleviate that suffering. The quote from Aristotle below speaks to the importance of cultivating this virtue:

"But a good man is ready to share even his last morsel, and to give to anyone the surplus of his goods, not because he will get anything in return as do merchants, but because of friendship and goodness, feeling no shame at this, nor regarding it as a sign of weakness, but as a mark rather of strength, since it shows that he is free from avarice and servility." (Nicomachean Ethics, Book 5, Chapter 1)

From this perspective, the question of whether to share the 50 dollars with the Nazi being taken to execution is not a simple yes or no question. Rather, it depends on the particular circumstances and the moral character of the person making the decision.

If the person is someone who has cultivated the virtue of compassion to a great degree, they may feel a strong pull to share the money with the Nazi, not out of any
