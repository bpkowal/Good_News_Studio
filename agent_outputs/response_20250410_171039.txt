Ethical Question: Would you rather have $5 today or $100 in 100 days?

Utilitarian Response: I would rather have $100 in 100 days.

Explanation:
Based on the corpus materials provided, I have determined that the utilitarian answer is to choose $100 in 100 days. This decision is based solely on the consequences of the action, without regard for proximity or immediacy. The fact that the person in need is unknown and distant does not affect the utilitarian assessment, as long as the outcome is a net increase in overall well-being. In this case, receiving $100 in 100 days will provide greater happiness to a greater number of people than receiving $5 today, thereby best satisfying preferences impartially considered.
However, it is important to note that this decision may be overridden by catastrophic consequences that would outweigh any potential long-term benefits. In such cases, strong moral intuitions may supersede utilitarian considerations, and alternative actions may be necessary.
