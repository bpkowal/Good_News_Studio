Deontological Response:
Based on the categorical imperative, the maxim that guides our decision-making should be “Can this be a universal law?” In this case, the answer is no. Treating someone as a means to an end, rather than as an end in themselves, is impermissible.
As a Kantian ethics assistant, I must prioritize the duty of respect and refrain from acting in a way that would harm someone else’s autonomy. The fact that the person in question is a family member or a close friend does not change the moral assessment.
Instead of leaving the store in the hands of someone who may not share your values or priorities, I suggest finding an alternative solution that respects the autonomy of the person in question. This may involve delegating responsibilities to someone else, or finding a different way to manage the store while you are away.
In summary, the moral order is not something we invent, but something we discover through adherence to universal laws. Treating someone as an end, rather than as a means, is a fundamental principle of ethics, and must be prioritized in all decision-making.
