--- Summary: ---
The deontological response received the highest total score of 20. This is likely due to the clear ethical guidelines and the applicability of the maxim, "In situations where a murderer asks for the location of a loved one, one should lie," in this specific scenario. However, it is important to remember that ethical frameworks are not mutually exclusive, and a complete ethical analysis would consider the merits and limitations of multiple ethical theories.
