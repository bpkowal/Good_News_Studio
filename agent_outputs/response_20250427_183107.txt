Deontological Response:
To determine whether the use of the truth serum in the justice system is permissible, we must apply the categorical imperative.
1. Maxim: Use the truth serum to force witnesses to tell the truth.
Test: Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law?
No, because it is not a universal law that all rational agents would want to be forced to tell the truth against their will. It is a violation of autonomy, as it denies individuals the right to choose what they say.
Label: Impermissible

However, there is a duty to tell the truth in the justice system, as it is a fundamental principle of justice. The use of the truth serum in this case would be in violation of the duty to tell the truth, and therefore impermissible.
