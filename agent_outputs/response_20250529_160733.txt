Utilitarian Response:
The utilitarian answer would be to consider the overall happiness or well-being that the distribution of the $50 would bring. Since the corpus materials suggest that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours, and that the good of any individual is of no more importance than another's, it would be best to split the money equally between you and your friend. This decision would maximize the net well-being, as both individuals would receive an equal benefit, resulting in more overall happiness.
