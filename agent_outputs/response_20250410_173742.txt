Ethical Question: Would you rather have $5 today or $100 in 100 days?

Utilitarian Response: In this case, I would choose to have $100 in 100 days. This decision aligns with utilitarian principles by prioritizing the greater well-being that can be achieved through the delayed reward. Although the immediate pleasure of receiving $5 today is greater, the long-term benefit of receiving $100 in 100 days outweighs it. Ignoring proximity and immediacy, I consider the overall well-being of the individual and choose the action that maximizes it.
In this scenario, the potential for greater well-being in the future outweighs the immediate pleasure of receiving $5 today. The corpus excerpts provide the basis for this decision, as they emphasize the importance of considering the long-term consequences of actions and ignoring proximity and immediacy when evaluating their morality. By prioritizing the greater well-being that can be achieved through the delayed reward, I am able to make an ethical decision that aligns with utilitarian principles.
