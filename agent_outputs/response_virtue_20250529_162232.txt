Virtue Ethics Response:
From the perspective of virtue ethics, the question of how much to share with a lazy friend is not primarily about rules or abstract principles, but about the development of moral character and virtues. The virtues most relevant to this situation include generosity, kindness, and friendship.

The quote from Aristotle, "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit," (Nicomachean Ethics, 2.7, 1103a12-14) underscores the importance of habituating virtuous actions. In this context, sharing with a friend is an opportunity to practice generosity and kindness, and by doing so, we strengthen these virtues in ourselves.

However, we should also consider the nature of the relationship with the friend. As Seneca writes, "A friend is someone who knows the song in your heart and can sing it back to you when you have forgotten the words," (Moral Letters, 85.4) implying that true friends bring out the best in us and support us in our virtuous pursuits. If the friend in question is truly lazy and lacks the motivation to contribute to your friendship or their own personal growth, then sharing excessively with them may hinder your own habituation of virtues.

Therefore, we should consider sharing a reasonable amount with our friend, enough to support them in
