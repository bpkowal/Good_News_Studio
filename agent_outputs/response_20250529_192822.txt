- “If we accept any principle of impartial benevolence, then we must accept that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours. When the loss to us is small and the gain to another is greater, it is wrong to favor ourselves.” (score: 10.23)
- "A utilitarian should acknowledge that the real value of future benefits may be lower in practice, not because they are less important morally, but because they are likely to achieve less in terms of well-being when eventually realized." (score: 8.06)

Utilitarian Response:
Given the ethical question at hand, the corpus materials suggest that we should impartially consider the preferences of all affected parties and prescribe the action that maximizes net well-being. In this case, we have two options: keeping $50 for ourselves today or sharing $100 with a friend in five years.

The first corpus excerpt indicates that we should ask what action best satisfies preferences impartially considered. In terms of preferences, both the self and the friend have an interest in receiving the money. However, the friend's preference for $100 in five years is not immediately realized, while the self's preference for $50 today is.

The second corpus excerpt suggests that we should not favor our own interests simply because they are ours, and that when the loss to us is small and the gain to another is greater, it is wrong to favor ourselves. In this case, the loss to the self ($50) is smaller than the gain to the friend ($100), so it would be wrong to favor ourselves.

The third corpus excerpt acknowledges that the real value of future benefits may be lower in practice due to their reduced ability to achieve well-being when eventually realized. However, this does not negate the principle of impartial benevolence, as the ultimate goal is still to maximize net well-being for all parties involved.
