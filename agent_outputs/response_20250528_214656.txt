- “If we accept any principle of impartial benevolence, then we must accept that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours. When the loss to us is small and the gain to another is greater, it is wrong to favor ourselves.” (score: 12.63)
- "The good of any one individual is of no more importance, from the point of view... of the universe, than the good of any other." (score: 11.41)
- "When the numbers become extreme, our intuitions must yield. If the alternative is a hundred thousand deaths, the wrongness of harming one innocent person becomes tragically outweighed." (score: 10.03)

Utilitarian Response:
Based on the corpus materials provided, a utilitarian ethics assistant would consider the consequences of serving an evil god versus the consequences of not serving him.

The first corpus excerpt emphasizes impartial benevolence and rejects the idea that our own interests count more just because they are ours. This implies that the potential harm or benefit to oneself should not be given more weight than the harm or benefit to others.

The second corpus excerpt states that an individual's good is of no greater importance than anyone else's from a universal perspective. This reinforces the idea that individual interests should not be prioritized over the collective good.

The third corpus excerpt suggests that when the numbers (in this case, the potential outcomes) become extreme, our intuitions must yield. In this situation, eternal torture for one individual versus no eternal torture for many others could be considered an extreme case.

Therefore, if serving an evil god would prevent eternal torture for many people, and the harm to oneself (serving the evil god) is outweighed by the net benefit to the greater good, then serving the evil god would be the utilitarian choice. However, it is important to note that this decision is not without moral ambiguity, as serving an evil god inherently involves harm to oneself and potentially to others in various ways.
