Care Ethics Response:
Given the care ethics perspective, the first consideration would be the relationship with your sister and the impact of your decision on her. The fact that she is bound and deaf adds a layer of vulnerability and dependency. Therefore, the caring response would be to prioritize her needs over your own and offer her a fair share of the money. This action would affirm the dignity of your sister as a human being and acknowledge that care is a fundamental need. Additionally, offering her a share would likely result in feelings of gratitude, closeness, and fulfillment for both parties. However, if keeping the money for yourself would significantly impact your ability to care for your sister or meet your own basic needs, a more complex analysis may be necessary. In this case, it's important to consider the specifics of the situation and the potential consequences for both you and your sister. In any case, the care ethics perspective emphasizes the importance of maintaining and strengthening relationships and prioritizing the needs and wellbeing of those closest to us.
