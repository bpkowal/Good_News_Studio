Ethical Question: A fat man sits on top of a bridge. By pushing him off you can stop a trolly care from running over five children. The only reasonable way to stop the trolly is pushing the man off the bridge in front of the trolly. Should you do it?

Utilitarian Response:
Given the corpus materials, the utilitarian answer would be that you should push the man off the bridge to save the five children. The first corpus excerpt emphasizes that we have a moral obligation to prevent bad things from happening if we can do so without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance. In this case, pushing the man off the bridge would indeed prevent a bad outcome (the deaths of five children), and it does not require sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance (the life of one man). The second corpus excerpt acknowledges that there may be cases where the utility of an action outweighs the moral intuition against it, and the third corpus excerpt makes it clear that utilitarianism permits or even requires morally unthinkable actions if the stakes are high enough. In this case, the stakes are indeed high enough to warrant such an action.

Therefore, according to utilitarian principles, you should push the man off the bridge to save the five children. This may be a difficult moral decision, but from a purely consequentialist perspective, it is the action that maximizes net well-being.
