Instead, we should consider the duty of justice, which could potentially require sharing the money to prevent harm or save lives, depending on the circumstances.
3. Duty: Justice

By refusing to share the money with the nazi agent, we may be perpetuating their suffering, but by sharing the money, we may be indirectly contributing to their ability to continue their oppressive actions. The most just action would depend on the specific circumstances and potential consequences.

5. Test: Can all rational agents
