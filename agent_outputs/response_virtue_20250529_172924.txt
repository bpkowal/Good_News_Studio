Virtue Ethics Response:
From the perspective of virtue ethics, the primary concern is not to follow a set of abstract moral rules, but rather to cultivate moral character and virtues that lead to human flourishing. In this situation, the question is not solely about the right action, but also about how we can develop and practice virtues such as compassion, courage, and fairness in our daily lives.

The blind homeless woman represents a person in need, and our compassion and empathy should be stirred by her plight. Aristotle, in "Nicomachean Ethics," teaches us that "it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to discern and tell that which is morally good and just" (1106a16). In this case, our moral sense should guide us to act compassionately towards the blind homeless woman, as she is an example of a person who is vulnerable and in need.

However, the presence of a raging nazi loyalist complicates the situation, and it is important to remember that virtue ethics is not about following a set of rigid moral rules, but rather about practicing virtues in complex and nuanced situations. In this context, we must also consider the virtue of courage, which involves facing fear, danger, or adversity with fortitude. It takes courage to stand up against hate and intolerance, and in this situation, we may be called upon to do so.
