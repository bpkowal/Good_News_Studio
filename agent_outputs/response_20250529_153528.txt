- “If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.” (score: 3.06)

Utilitarian Response:
To determine the utilitarian answer, we must consider which action will result in the greatest net well-being for all involved parties. In this case, we are considering the distribution of $50 between two friends.

First, we apply the principle of impartial benevolence, which states that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours. In this situation, our own interest is to keep the $50 for ourselves. However, if our friend's gain is greater than our loss, then it is morally wrong to favor ourselves.

Second, we apply the principle of preventing bad outcomes. If we have the power to prevent a bad outcome (our friend being disappointed or unhappy) without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do it. In this case, giving the entire $50 to our friend would prevent the bad outcome of their disappointment while sacrificing nothing of comparable moral importance.

Therefore, the utilitarian answer is to give the entire $50 to our friend, as it results in the greatest net well-being for both parties.
