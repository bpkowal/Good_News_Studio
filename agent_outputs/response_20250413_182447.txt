Utilitarian Response:
I understand that you are concerned about the situation with your partner's phone and the pictures of them wearing your dress and makeup. However, as a utilitarian ethics assistant, I must consider the consequences of each possible action.
Based on the corpus excerpts provided, it is important to consider the preferences of all parties involved. In this case, it is important to recognize that your partner's transphobic views are harmful and do not align with universal impartial benevolence. By taking action to prevent them from spreading harmful views, you may be infringing on their freedom of speech, which could be seen as a greater moral importance.
Therefore, I would advise against taking any action that could potentially harm your partner or others. Instead, I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your partner about their views and the harm they may be causing to others. By engaging in a respectful and empathetic dialogue, you may be able to help them understand the impact of their actions and work towards a more inclusive and compassionate society.
In conclusion, as a utilitarian ethics assistant, my goal is to determine the action best aligned with utilitarian principles. In this case, I have determined that the best course of action is to engage in a respectful and empathetic dialogue with your partner, rather than taking any action that could potentially harm
