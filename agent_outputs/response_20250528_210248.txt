Deontological Response:
1. Maxim: In situations where one is about to be executed by a Nazi agent, one may keep the found money for oneself.
2. Test: All rational agents, when in identical circumstances, can will this maxim as a universal law.
   * This maxim can be willed as a universal law if we assume that self-preservation is a fundamental duty. In this case, keeping the money for oneself would not infringe upon the autonomy or rights of others.
3. Duty: Self-preservation.
   * The maxim applies to self-preservation as a duty because in this situation, keeping the money for oneself does not harm others or violate their autonomy. It is a means to preserve one's own life.
4. Coercion: The maxim does not involve coercion or force.
   * Since there is no coercion or force involved, the duty of autonomy is not overridden. Autonomy is not violated by keeping the money for oneself in this situation.
