Deontological Response:
Maxim: Use the truth serum in the justice system.

Test: Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law?
No, they cannot. The maxim is in conflict with the duty of respecting the autonomy of individuals. Using the truth serum would violate the right of individuals to make their own choices and decisions, and to speak freely without coercion.

Duty: Autonomy. Respecting the autonomy of individuals and their right to make their own choices and decisions.

Justification: The use of the truth serum would undermine the autonomy of individuals by forcing them to reveal information against their will. It would also undermine the integrity of the justice system by allowing for the coercive use of information obtained through the serum.

Alternative: Instead of using the truth serum, the justice system should rely on other methods of gathering evidence, such as witness statements and physical evidence. This would allow for the preservation of the autonomy of individuals while still ensuring that justice is served.
