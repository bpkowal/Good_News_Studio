Utilitarian Response:
Given the corpus materials, the utilitarian answer would be to return the fifty dollars to your neighbor, as not doing so would involve harming them (taking their money) and there is no comparable moral importance in keeping it for yourself. The potential harm to your neighbor, in terms of loss and potential mistrust, outweighs any potential benefit to you.

However, if the situation were such that returning the money would lead to catastrophic consequences (for instance, a mob would come after you to retrieve the money and the only way to prevent harm to innocent bystanders would be to keep the money), then the utilitarian principle would allow for the harm to your neighbor as a means to prevent greater harm. In this case, the catastrophic consequences would outweigh the harm to your neighbor.

Therefore, in the absence of catastrophic consequences, the utilitarian principle dictates returning the money to your neighbor.
