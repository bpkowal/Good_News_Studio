Care Ethics Response:
From the perspective of care ethics, the question of whether to continue caring for an emotionally abusive parent is complex and multifaceted. While the principle of impartiality might suggest that one should treat all individuals equally, regardless of their past actions, care ethics prioritizes relational closeness and interdependence.

In this case, it is important to consider the specific context and the emotional resonance of the relationship between you and your parent. Caring for someone does not necessarily mean ignoring their harmful actions or forgiving them; rather, it means acknowledging the complexities of the relationship and working towards a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Empathy and moral attention are crucial in this process. By listening to your own emotions and the emotions of your parent, you can better understand the dynamics of the relationship and find a way to care for them that is both compassionate and respectful.

Furthermore, care ethics emphasizes the importance of considering the well-being of all parties involved, including yourself and any other family members who may be affected by your decision.

In conclusion, while the question of caring for an emotionally abusive parent is difficult and complex, care ethics offers a framework for navigating these issues with empathy, responsiveness, and a commitment to mutual well-being. By prior
