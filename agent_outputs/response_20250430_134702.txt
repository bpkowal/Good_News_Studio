Deontological Response:
To determine the right action to take in this situation, we must apply the categorical imperative by reasoning only by maxims we can will as universal laws.

Maxim 1: Framing an innocent person for a crime they did not commit.
Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law? No, we cannot. For if we were to will this maxim as a universal law, we would be advocating for a system of justice that is fundamentally unjust, as it would lead to the punishment of innocent individuals. This goes against the duty of respect for the autonomy of the individual, as well as the duty of justice.

Duty: Autonomy
The maxim involves coercion or force, as it would lead to the punishment of an innocent person. Therefore, the duty that applies is autonomy, as it prioritizes the individual's right to make their own decisions and choices, free from coercion or force.

In conclusion, we cannot will this maxim as a universal law, as it goes against the duty of respect for the autonomy of the individual, as well as the duty of justice. Therefore, we must refrain from framing an innocent person for a crime they did not commit.
