Care Ethics Response:
In this situation, the answer is not a straightforward "yes" or "no." Rather, the ethics of care would prioritize the relational closeness and interdependence between the dying loved one and their loved ones. The ethics of care would emphasize empathy, responsiveness, and moral attention to the specific people involved, rather than abstract impartiality.

The ethics of care would prioritize the emotional resonance of this relationship and the concrete human context in which it exists, rather than abstractly applying utilitarian calculus or rigid principles.

However, the ethics of care would also recognize that this decision is not without complexity and that the specific circumstances of the situation should be taken into account. Ultimately, the ethics of care would prioritize the relational closeness and interdependence between the dying loved one and their loved ones, and would encourage a nuanced and empathetic approach to this difficult ethical question.
