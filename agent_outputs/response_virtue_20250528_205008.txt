Virtue Ethics Response:
From the perspective of virtue ethics, the focus is on the development of moral character and virtues, rather than adhering to a set of rules. In this situation, the virtues that come into play are honesty, compassion, and courage.

Honesty is a virtue that involves being truthful and sincere in our actions and words. Keeping the money for ourselves and not disclosing the fact could be seen as a violation of honesty. However, virtue ethics does not provide a clear answer on whether keeping the money is a vice or not, as the situation is complex and context-dependent. Instead, it encourages us to consider the motivations behind our actions and how they align with our character development.

Compassion is a virtue that involves feeling empathy and concern for others and acting on that feeling to help them. Sharing the money with the nazi agent goes against our moral intuition, as they represent an immoral and harmful ideology. However, virtue ethics would encourage us to reflect on the human aspect of the agent and consider the potential consequences of our actions on their life. Are we making the situation worse or better by sharing or not sharing the money?

Courage is a virtue that involves facing fear, danger, or adversity with bravery and resolve. In this situation, the fear of being seen as collaborating with a nazi agent could make it difficult to share the money
