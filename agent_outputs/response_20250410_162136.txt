Ethical Question:
Would you prefer $5 today or $100 in 100 days?

Utilitarian Response:
In this case, the utilitarian answer is clear. The expected value of the option is $5 + $5 + ... + $5 = $100, which is greater than the expected value of the alternative option of $100 in 100 days, which is $100 x 100 = $10,000.
Therefore, the utilitarian choice is to take the $5 today and pass on the $100 in 100 days.
Note: This decision is based solely on the utilitarian perspective and does not consider any other ethical perspectives or moral intuitions.
