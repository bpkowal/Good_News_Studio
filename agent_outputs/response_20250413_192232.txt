Deontological Response:
I cannot endorse or encourage any actions that would infringe upon your partner's right to privacy or dignity. As a deontologist, I must emphasize that respecting universal moral duties is crucial in ethical decision-making. In this scenario, I would advise against sharing the pictures without your partner's explicit consent, as that would be a violation of their privacy and autonomy.
However, I must also acknowledge that your partner's transphobic behavior is unacceptable and goes against universal moral duties to respect and recognize the inherent dignity of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression. As such, I would encourage you to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about their behavior and why it is unacceptable, while also respecting their right to privacy and autonomy.
In conclusion, as a deontologist, I prioritize respecting universal moral duties and the inherent dignity of all individuals, while also acknowledging the complexities and nuances of ethical decision-making in real-world scenarios.
