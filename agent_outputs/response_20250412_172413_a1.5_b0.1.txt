Care Ethics Response:
From the perspective of care ethics, the relationship between a parent and child is inherently relational and interdependent. While it is understandable that you may feel hurt or resentful towards your parent due to their past actions, the current reality of their vulnerability and dependence on you must be taken into account. Prioritizing their well-being and care is crucial, even if it means setting boundaries or taking steps to protect yourself.

In this scenario, it is important to consider the ethical principles of care ethics, such as empathy, responsiveness, and moral attention to the specific people involved. Rather than relying solely on abstract principles or utilitarian calculations, we must prioritize the well-being and flourishing of both yourself and your parent.

By considering the ethical principles of care ethics, we can navigate complex and emotionally charged situations with greater compassion and ethical awareness.
