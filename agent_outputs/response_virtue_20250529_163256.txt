Virtue Ethics Response:
From the perspective of virtue ethics, the focus is on the development of moral character and virtues. In this situation, the question is not about following a specific rule or principle, but rather about how we should act in order to cultivate virtues and contribute to human flourishing.

The virtue of generosity is particularly relevant here. Aristotle emphasizes that generosity is not just about giving material possessions, but also about our attitude towards those we give to. He says, "Generosity comes into being from fortune and wealth, since it is possible to give only what one has, and the greater the gift the greater is the virtue." (Nicomachean Ethics, 4.1.1120a33)

In this scenario, finding 3 dollars on the ground presents an opportunity to exercise generosity. By sharing the money with your mom, you are able to demonstrate kindness, love, and consideration towards her. This not only shows your generosity, but also strengthens the bond between you and your mom. As Aristotle notes, "Friendship is a partnership of equals, or at any rate of mutual goodwill, and in a certain sense also of virtue." (Nicomachean Ethics, 8.2.1155b20)

Sharing the money with your mom in a generous manner not only benefits her, but also contributes to your own
