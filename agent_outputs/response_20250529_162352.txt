Deontological Response:
Maxim: I will give my lazy friend more than a fair share of my earnings, as I feel generous in this moment.

Test: All rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law? No, because if everyone gave more than a fair share to their lazy friends, there would be no incentive for people to work hard and earn their own income. This goes against the duty of justice, which requires fairness and equality.

Instead, the duty of autonomy (respect for rational agency) and impartiality (consistent treatment) should be upheld. The maxim should be: I will give my fair share to my friend, as I would expect the same treatment from others. This allows everyone to maintain their autonomy and respects the impartial treatment of all individuals.
