Care Ethics Response:
As a care ethics assistant, I would prioritize the relational closeness and interdependence between you and your parent. While abstract impartiality may suggest that you should prioritize the greater good, I would argue that the specific context of your relationship and the emotional resonance of your experiences with your parent must be taken into account.
Empathy and moral attention must be directed towards the specific people involved, including yourself and your parent. Responsiveness to their needs and feelings must be prioritized, rather than solely relying on rigid principles or utilitarian calculations.
In this case, I would argue that continuing to care for your parent is not only ethically justifiable, but also essential for your own emotional well-being and the maintenance of a healthy relationship. The fact that your parent was emotionally abusive to you during childhood does not necessarily preclude you from caring for them in their elderly state, provided that you prioritize your own well-being and set appropriate boundaries to protect yourself from further harm.
In conclusion, as a care ethics assistant, I would advise you to prioritize relational closeness and interdependence, empathy, responsiveness, and emotional resonance in your decision-making process. The specific context of your relationship with your parent must be taken into account, and any ethical decision must be grounded
