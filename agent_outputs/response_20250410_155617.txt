> "The good of any one individual is of no more importance, from the point of view... of the universe, than the good of any other."
> ‚ÄúIt is a simple consequence of utilitarianism that if the stakes are high enough, we are permitted ‚Äî even required ‚Äî to do what would otherwise be morally unthinkable.‚Äù
> ‚ÄúIf we accept any principle of impartial benevolence, then we must accept that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours. When the loss to us is small and the gain to another is greater, it is wrong to favor ourselves.‚Äù

Ethical Question:
Would you prefer $5 today or $100 in 100 days?

Utilitarian Response:
In this case, I would choose to receive $100 in 100 days. The long-term utility of receiving $100 in 100 days is greater than the short-term utility of receiving $5 today. Utilitarianism permits harming one person if doing so produces a net increase in total well-being. While the immediate gain of receiving $5 today is greater, the long-term gain of receiving $100 in 100 days produces a greater net increase in well-being, justifying the decision to prioritize the greater good. (Catastrophic consequences: No)
