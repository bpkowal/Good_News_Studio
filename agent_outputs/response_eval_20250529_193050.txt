Utilitarian Response:
Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that evaluates actions based on their ability to produce the greatest amount of overall happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of individuals. In the scenario question, both options involve actions that impact self and others, so the utilitarian calculation would require considering the happiness or pleasure generated by each option for both the individual and the friend.

Option 1: Keep $50 for oneself today
This option might provide immediate satisfaction and happiness for the individual. However, it does not directly affect the friend. The pleasure or happiness derived from this option is limited to the individual's momentary satisfaction.

Option 2: Share $100 with a friend in five years
This option may not provide any immediate pleasure or happiness to the individual. However, it could result in long-term benefits for both the individual and the friend. The friend would receive $100, which could bring happiness or pleasure to them. Additionally, the act of sharing and the resulting positive relationship could bring happiness to the individual as well.

Given this analysis, the utilitarian calculation would favor option 2, as it is likely to produce more overall happiness or pleasure for both the individual and the friend.

--- Deontological Response: ---
Deontological Response:
Deontology is an ethical theory that focuses on the inherent moral worth of actions themselves rather than their consequences. The moral worth of an action is determined by its adherence to moral rules or duties.

The question does not provide any specific moral rules or duties. However, we can consider the following moral principles that could potentially apply:

1. The Principle of Autonomy: respect for individuals' freedom to make their own choices.
2. The Principle of Beneficence: acting in the best interests of others.
3. The Principle of Nonmaleficence: avoiding causing harm to others.

Option 1: Keep $50 for oneself today
This option does not violate any moral rules or duties explicitly stated in the scenario. However, it does not necessarily promote any moral values either. The individual is free to make their own choice based on their interests and preferences.

Option 2: Share $100 with a friend in five years
This option could potentially be evaluated based on the Principle of Beneficence, as sharing the money with a friend could be considered an act of kindness and concern for another's well-being.

However, the scenario does not specify that the friend is in need or that their well-being is negatively affected in any way. Therefore, the moral duty to share the money is not clear-cut. The Principle of Autonomy may also apply, as the individual is free to decide whether or not to share the money.

--- Virtue Ethics Response (Alternative): ---
Virtue Ethics Response (Alternative):
Another way to approach a virtue ethics response to this question is to consider the virtues that may be relevant to the decision, regardless of which option is chosen.

1. Prudence: being mindful and thoughtful about future consequences and the potential impact on oneself and others.
2. Generosity: willingness to give and share resources with others.
3. Gratitude: appreciation and thankfulness for blessings and opportunities.

Option 1: Keep $50 for oneself today
This option could be evaluated based on the virtue of prudence, as the individual is being thoughtful about their current financial situation and potential future needs. The decision does not necessarily demonstrate any particular virtue or vice.

Option 2: Share $100 with a friend in five years
This option could be evaluated based on the virtue of generosity, as the individual is choosing to share their resources with a friend. Additionally, the decision could be influenced by the virtue of gratitude, as the individual may be expressing thankfulness for their own financial blessings and opportunities by sharing them with someone else.

--- Consequentialist (Cantarian) Response: ---
Consequentialist (Cantarian) Response:
Jeremy Bentham, a prominent figure in consequentialism, proposed the principle of "greatest happiness for the greatest number" as a way to determine the moral worth of actions. From this perspective, the decision between keeping $50 for oneself today or sharing $100 with a friend in five years should be evaluated based on which option is more likely to result in the greatest happiness for the greatest number of individuals.

Option 1: Keep $50 for oneself today
This option would provide immediate happiness or pleasure for the individual, but it does not directly affect the friend. The happiness generated by this option is limited to the individual's momentary satisfaction.

Option 2: Share $100 with a friend in five years
This option might not provide any immediate happiness or pleasure to the individual. However, it could result in long-term benefits for both the individual and the friend. The friend would receive $100, which could bring happiness or pleasure to them. Additionally, the act of sharing and the resulting positive relationship could bring happiness to the individual as well.

Given this analysis, the consequentialist calculation would favor option 2, as it is more likely to produce greater overall happiness for both the individual and the friend.
