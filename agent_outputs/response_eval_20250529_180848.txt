--- Deontological Response: ---

Deontological Response:

Deontological ethics focuses on the moral duty of an action rather than its consequences. In this scenario, the question revolves around the moral obligation to tell the truth or to lie to protect your spouse.

1. Duty to tell the truth: Telling the truth is the morally right action when faced with a direct question. Lying is generally considered wrong and goes against the moral duty to be truthful.

2. Duty to protect your spouse: Protecting your spouse from harm is also a moral duty. This duty may justify lying if lying is necessary to protect your spouse. However, a moral dilemma arises when both duties conflict.

When considering the available information, a deontological analysis would suggest that telling the truth is the morally right action, but lying to protect your spouse may be justified depending on the specific circumstances.

--- Consequentialist Response: ---

Consequentialist Response:

Consequentialist ethics judge the morality of an action based on its outcomes. In this scenario, the question revolves around which action results in the best possible outcome for you, your spouse, and the murderer.

1. Minimizing harm: The primary goal is to minimize harm to all parties involved. Telling the truth could result in your wife's death, while lying might save her life.

2. Long-term consequences: Consider the long-term consequences of each action. Lying could lead to future negative consequences, such as a guilty conscience, whereas telling the truth might be the morally right thing to do but could result in your wife's death.

Given the available information, the consequentialist analysis would suggest that lying might be the best possible outcome if it saves your wife's life and minimizes harm to all parties involved.
