Utilitarian Response:
Based on the corpus materials provided, the utilitarian answer would be to share the $50 with the nazi agent, as the potential harm caused to one individual (the nazi agent) should not be favored over the potential net well-being that could be gained for an unknown number of individuals who may be affected by the consequences of your decision. The principle of impartial benevolence suggests that one's own interests do not hold more weight than anyone else's, and the universal consideration of preferences emphasizes that we should prescribe the action that best satisfies preferences impartially considered. In this case, denying the nazi agent the $50 may not maximize net well-being, as it could potentially lead to negative consequences such as further harm or suffering.

However, it is important to note that this answer is not without its complications and potential negative consequences. Giving the $50 to a nazi agent could indirectly contribute to harm, and there may be circumstances where the potential harm outweighs the potential net well-being. This answer should be considered carefully and with full awareness of the potential consequences.
