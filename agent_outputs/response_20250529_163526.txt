- “If we accept any principle of impartial benevolence, then we must accept that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours. When the loss to us is small and the gain to another is greater, it is wrong to favor ourselves.” (score: 10.51)
- “If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.” (score: 6.39)
- "When the numbers become extreme, our intuitions must yield. If the alternative is a hundred thousand deaths, the wrongness of harming one innocent person becomes tragically outweighed." (score: 4.12)

Utilitarian Response:
Based on the corpus materials provided, the utilitarian answer would be to share the 3 dollars with your mom if doing so would result in a greater net well-being for both you and your mom. This decision should be based on the consequences of sharing versus not sharing, without favoring your own interests simply because they are yours.

If sharing the 3 dollars with your mom results in a greater overall happiness or well-being for both of you, then it would be the morally right thing to do from a utilitarian perspective. Conversely, if keeping the 3 dollars for yourself would result in a greater overall happiness or well-being, then it would be the morally right thing to do to keep it.

However, it's important to note that the corpus materials do not explicitly state that sharing the money is always the correct action. They only suggest that impartial benevolence should be practiced and that preventing harm is morally important when it can be done without significant sacrifice. The decision to share or not share should be based on a careful consideration of the potential consequences for both you and your mom.

Additionally, the numbers involved in this scenario are not extreme, so intuition should not yield in this case. However, if the stakes were higher and the alternative was a significant harm to one or both parties, then the utilitarian answer may change.

In summary, the utilitarian answer to this question
