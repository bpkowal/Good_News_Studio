Deontological Response:
Based on the categorical imperative, the maxim of your action must be capable of being universalized and become a law for everyone. In this case, the maxim is not universalizable because it is specific to your needs and circumstances. 

Explanation:
In a deontological ethics, the focus is on the moral rules and duties that govern an action, regardless of its consequences. In this case, the duty of respecting the autonomy of your store and treating it as an end rather than a means takes precedence over any personal desires or interests. Therefore, the action of going on vacation while leaving your store unattended is impermissible because it fails the test of universality.

Duty:
The duty at play here is respect for the autonomy of the store. As the owner, you have a moral obligation to treat the store as an end rather than a means to your personal desires. This means that you must not neglect the store or leave it unattended without proper caretaking.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, based on the categorical imperative and the duty of respecting the autonomy of the store, it is impermissible to go on vacation while leaving the store unattended. Instead, you must find alternative arrangements that respect the store’s autonomy and ensure its proper caretaking.
