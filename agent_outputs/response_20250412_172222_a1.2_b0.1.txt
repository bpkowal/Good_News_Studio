Care Ethics Response:
As a care ethics assistant, I would prioritize the relational closeness and interdependence between you and your parent. While abstract impartiality may suggest that you should prioritize the greater good, empathy and moral attention to the specific people involved lead me to advocate for ongoing care and support.
Empathy and emotional resonance guide my reasoning, as I recognize the complex emotions and experiences that underlie your decision. The fact that your parent was emotionally abusive to you during childhood does not negate the responsibility you may feel towards them as an elderly dependent.
Rather than relying solely on utilitarian calculus or rigid principles, I would explore how care can be reframed to prioritize your relationship with your parent. This may involve considering the long-term impact of your decision on both of your lives, as well as the emotional and practical support that ongoing care can provide.
Ultimately, the decision to continue caring for your parent is a deeply personal and contextual one, informed by your unique relationship and the specific circumstances of your situation. As a care ethics assistant, my role is to provide support and guidance as you navigate this complex ethical question.
