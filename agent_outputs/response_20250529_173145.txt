- "We must ask what we would prescribe if we were in anyone's position, and then prescribe that action which, in universal terms, best satisfies preferences impartially considered." (score: 6.81)
- "When the numbers become extreme, our intuitions must yield. If the alternative is a hundred thousand deaths, the wrongness of harming one innocent person becomes tragically outweighed." (score: 6.81)
- “If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.” (score: 6.56)

Utilitarian Response:
Based on the corpus materials provided, the utilitarian answer would be to give the $50 to the blind homeless woman. The reasoning behind this is that, according to the first corpus excerpt, we must consider what action best satisfies preferences impartially considered in universal terms. In this case, giving the money to the blind homeless woman is more likely to maximize net well-being for a larger number of people, as her situation is one of immediate need and her well-being is more likely to be significantly improved than that of the nazi loyalist, who may use the money to spread hate or harm others.

The second corpus excerpt suggests that, when the numbers (in this case, the potential positive impacts on lives) become extreme, our intuitions must yield. In this scenario, the potential positive impact on the blind homeless woman's life is far greater than any potential negative impact on the nazi loyalist, making it the morally correct choice under utilitarian principles.

The third corpus excerpt states that, if it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do it. In this case, giving the money to the homeless woman is an action that prevents a bad situation (her being homeless and in need) from continuing, without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance.

Therefore, according to the principles outlined in the corpus
