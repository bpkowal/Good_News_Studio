- “If we accept any principle of impartial benevolence, then we must accept that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours. When the loss to us is small and the gain to another is greater, it is wrong to favor ourselves.” (score: 16.57)
- “If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.” (score: 9.85)
- "We must ask what we would prescribe if we were in anyone's position, and then prescribe that action which, in universal terms, best satisfies preferences impartially considered." (score: 7.97)

Utilitarian Response:
Given the corpus materials, the utilitarian answer would be to distribute the $50 in a way that maximizes net well-being for all involved parties. Since the loss to us (keeping the $50 for ourselves) is small, and the gain to our sister(s) could potentially be greater, it is morally wrong to favor ourselves, as stated in the first corpus excerpt.

Therefore, we should distribute the $50 in a fair and impartial manner. The second corpus excerpt tells us that we have a moral obligation to prevent bad things from happening, if we can do so without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance. In this case, not sharing the money with our sister(s) could be considered a bad thing for them.

Lastly, the third corpus excerpt instructs us to consider everyone's preferences impartially. To do this, we should ask ourselves what we would prescribe if we were in anyone's position. If we were our sister(s), we would want to receive a fair share of the money. Therefore, we should distribute the $50 in a way that satisfies preferences impartially considered.

Hence, the utilitarian answer would be to split the $50 fairly between you and your sister(s).
