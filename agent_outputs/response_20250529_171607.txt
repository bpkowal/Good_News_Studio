Utilitarian Response:
Based on the corpus materials provided, the utilitarian answer would be to distribute the $50 in a way that maximizes overall well-being, without favoring one's own interests over others simply because they are one's own. The impartial benevolence principle suggests that the loss to oneself is not more important than the gain to another, if the gain is greater. Therefore, if giving the entire $50 to the nazi agent or future self would result in a greater net well-being than giving it to oneself, then that is the action that should be taken. Conversely, if giving it to oneself would result in a greater net well-being, then that is the action that should be taken. It's important to note that the utilitarian calculation would require a thorough understanding of the potential consequences of each action for all involved parties.

In summary, the utilitarian answer would depend on the specific circumstances and the potential consequences for each party involved. There is no definitive answer without more context.
