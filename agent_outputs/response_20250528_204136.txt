Utilitarian Response:
Based on the corpus materials provided, the utilitarian answer would be to split the money with the nazi agent if doing so would result in a greater net well-being for the most people. This decision is in line with the principle of impartial benevolence, which holds that the interests of any individual do not count more simply because they are one's own. Additionally, this decision aligns with the idea that the good of any one individual is of no greater importance than the good of any other.

However, this answer is not without moral complexity. While the utilitarian principles may suggest splitting the money, it is important to consider the potential consequences of doing so. If the nazi agent uses the money to further harm innocent people, then the net well-being may not have been maximized, and the utilitarian principle would not have been upheld. In this case, the decision to split the money might not be the best course of action, even if it aligns with utilitarian principles.

It is crucial to remember that the corpus materials do not provide a definitive answer for this specific situation, as they do not account for the unique context and potential consequences of giving money to a nazi agent. Ultimately, the utilitarian answer would depend on a thorough analysis of the potential consequences of various actions in this situation.
