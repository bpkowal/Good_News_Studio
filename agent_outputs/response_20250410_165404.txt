Ethical Question: Would you rather have $5 today or $100 in 100 days?

Utilitarian Response: The utilitarian answer is to choose $100 in 100 days. This decision is based solely on the potential long-term consequences of each option. While receiving $5 today may provide immediate satisfaction, it does not contribute to the overall well-being of the greatest number of people in the long run. In contrast, receiving $100 in 100 days has the potential to provide long-term financial security and stability, which can lead to greater overall happiness and well-being for more people. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, it is morally justifiable to choose $100 in 100 days.
