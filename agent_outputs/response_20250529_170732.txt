Care Ethics Response:
First, consider the relationship between your present and future self. You are not two separate individuals, but rather one person at different points in time. From a care ethics perspective, it is important to prioritize the relationship and interdependence between the two selves.

Using the corpus materials, mutual autonomy suggests that there should be mutual understandings and acceptances between the selves regarding how the money will be shared. This could involve considering the needs and desires of both selves.

Empathy and responsiveness also play a role here. Try to imagine how your future self might feel if they received no money at all or a significantly smaller amount. Consider the emotional impact this might have on the relationship between the two selves.

Lastly, caring for your future self is not solely a burden or obligation, but also a source of fulfillment and growth. By setting aside some money for your future self, you are demonstrating care and concern for their wellbeing.

So, based on care ethics, consider splitting the money in a way that prioritizes the relationship and interdependence between the two selves, taking into account the needs, desires, and feelings of both selves.
