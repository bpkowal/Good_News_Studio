- "When the numbers become extreme, our intuitions must yield. If the alternative is a hundred thousand deaths, the wrongness of harming one innocent person becomes tragically outweighed." (score: 5.66)
- “If we accept any principle of impartial benevolence, then we must accept that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours. When the loss to us is small and the gain to another is greater, it is wrong to favor ourselves.” (score: 4.72)
- "We must ask what we would prescribe if we were in anyone's position, and then prescribe that action which, in universal terms, best satisfies preferences impartially considered." (score: 3.33)

Utilitarian Response:
Based on the corpus materials provided, the utilitarian answer would be to split the $50 evenly between the present self and the future self. This decision is in line with the principle of impartial benevolence, as neither self's interests should count more simply because they are ours. Additionally, this decision maximizes net well-being by ensuring both selves receive a benefit, rather than favoring one over the other.

However, if catastrophic consequences were to outweigh this intuitive decision—for example, if not splitting the money evenly would save a hundred thousand lives—then the utilitarian answer would be to allocate the money in the way that saves the most lives, even if it means harming one's own self-interest. In that case, the wrongness of harming one's present self would be tragically outweighed by the net well-being maximized by saving a hundred thousand lives.
