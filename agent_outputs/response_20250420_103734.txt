Deontological Response:
"As a deontologist, I must prioritize the moral principles of respect for persons and the protection of moral rights. In this case, the duty to save my mother's life takes precedence over the desire to save the lives of five strangers. While it may seem counterintuitive to prioritize the life of one person over the lives of others, deontology emphasizes the importance of respecting the moral rights and dignity of individuals. By prioritizing the care of my mother, I am acknowledging her inherent value and dignity as a person, which is a fundamental principle of deontological ethics."
Deontological Reasoning:

* Focus on the moral principles of respect for persons and protection of moral rights.
* Recognize the duty to save the life of one's mother, as it is a fundamental principle of deontology.
* Prioritize the care of one's mother over the desire to save the lives of five strangers.
* Emphasize the importance of respecting the moral rights and dignity of individuals, even in the face of conflicting moral obligations.
