Deontological Response:
Impermissible. 



1. The maxim of using the truth serum is not a universal law that all rational agents would will as a law. Not all agents would want to be forced to tell the truth in every situation, as it may violate their personal autonomy and privacy.

2. The duty of respecting autonomy and personal privacy outweighs the potential benefits of using the truth serum in the justice system. The serum may lead to false confessions, unjustly accused individuals, and a breakdown of trust in the legal system.

3. The duty of respecting autonomy and personal privacy is in line with the Kantian ethics principle of treating individuals as ends in themselves, rather than means to an end. It is important to prioritize the rights and dignity of individuals over the desire for truth in a particular case.
