Ethical Question: Would you rather have $5 today or $100 in 100 days?

Utilitarian Response: In this case, the utilitarian answer is to take the $5 today. The immediate utility of receiving $5 is greater than the potential utility of receiving $100 in 100 days. While it may be tempting to take the $100 in the future, the immediate utility of the $5 today is greater, and therefore the action that maximizes total well-being is to take the $5.
Note: This decision is based solely on utilitarian principles and does not take into account any other ethical considerations or moral intuitions.
