Ethical Question: Would you rather have $5 today or $100 in 100 days?

Utilitarian Response: I would rather have $5 today.

Explanation:
The utilitarian perspective prioritizes immediate well-being over future well-being. In this case, receiving $5 today provides immediate satisfaction, which matters more than the potential future benefit of receiving $100 in 100 days. The fact that the future benefit may be just as intense is irrelevant, as it will not be experienced until later. Therefore, the decision is based solely on the immediate consequences, which favor taking the $5 today.
