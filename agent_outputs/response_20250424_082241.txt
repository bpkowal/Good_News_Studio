Care Ethics Response:
Thank you for sharing this ethical question with me! It's important to prioritize your well-being and take a much-needed vacation. However, I understand your concern about leaving your store in good hands. Here are some care-ethics-informed suggestions to address this issue:

1. Build a support network: Consider asking a trustworthy colleague or friend to check in on the store while you're away. This way, you can ensure that your store is being taken care of, and someone will be available to handle any urgent matters that may arise.
2. Establish clear expectations: Before you leave, make sure that your colleague or friend understands your expectations regarding the store's operations. This includes the daily tasks, responsibilities, and any specific instructions or protocols you have in place.
3. Foster open communication: Encourage your support network to communicate openly and transparently about any issues or concerns they may have while you're away. This can help you address any problems proactively and ensure that your store is running smoothly.
4. Prioritize relationships: Rather than solely focusing on abstract concepts like individual autonomy or utilitarian calculations, prioritize the relationships involved. Think about how your actions will impact your colleague, friend, or other individuals involved in caring for your store.
