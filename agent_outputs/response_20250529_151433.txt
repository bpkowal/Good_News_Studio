- “If we accept any principle of impartial benevolence, then we must accept that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours. When the loss to us is small and the gain to another is greater, it is wrong to favor ourselves.” (score: 9.03)
- “If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.” (score: 6.87)
- "When the numbers become extreme, our intuitions must yield. If the alternative is a hundred thousand deaths, the wrongness of harming one innocent person becomes tragically outweighed." (score: 5.75)

Utilitarian Response:
Based on the corpus materials provided, the utilitarian answer would be to share the money with your blind and deaf sister. The first corpus excerpt emphasizes the importance of impartial benevolence and recognizing that one's own interests do not hold more value just because they are one's own. The second corpus excerpt suggests that preventing harm or promoting good, even if it means sacrificing something of lesser value, is the morally right action. In this case, the potential loss to you of the $20 is small compared to the gain of providing your sister with the means to improve her situation. The third corpus excerpt suggests that when the numbers become extreme, intuitions must yield, and the potential harm to your sister, who is unable to benefit from the money due to her disabilities, would indeed constitute a significant harm that outweighs the lesser harm to you. Therefore, according to utilitarian principles, sharing the money with your sister is the ethical course of action.
