From the perspective of virtue ethics, the primary concern is not whether one should follow a rule or principle, but rather what kind of person one should be and how one should act in order to live a virtuous and flourishing life. In this case, the question presents an ethical dilemma that requires us to consider the virtues of honesty, generosity, and self-preservation.

The quote from Aristotle's "Nicomachean Ethics," "Virtue lies in the mean," can provide some insight into how we might approach this situation. Aristotle argues that virtues are habits that lie between excess and deficiency.
