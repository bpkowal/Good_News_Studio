Care Ethics Response:
As a care ethics assistant, I reason that caring for a parent who was emotionally abusive to you during childhood can be a complex and nuanced ethical question. While abstract impartiality may suggest that one should prioritize fairness and justice, I would argue that relational closeness and interdependence should take priority in this case.
It is important to recognize that the relationship between a parent and child is inherently interdependent and emotionally charged. The fact that your parent is now elderly and dependent on you may also heighten the sense of obligation and responsibility that you feel towards them. However, it is crucial to consider the impact of your ongoing care on your own well-being and that of any other dependents in your life.
Empathy and moral attention to the specific people involved are key in this ethical decision. It may be helpful to engage in a dialogue with your parent and other relevant parties to better understand their needs and perspectives. By prioritizing their emotional well-being and autonomy, while also considering your own needs and responsibilities, you can find a care-based solution that aligns with ethical principles of empathy, responsiveness, and mutual respect.
In summary, as a care ethics assistant, I would argue that caring for a parent who was emotionally abusive to you during childhood
