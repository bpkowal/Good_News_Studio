Utilitarianism Response:
From the perspective of utilitarianism, the question of whether to share the 50 dollars with a Nazi being taken to execution should be answered based on which option would bring about the greatest overall happiness for the greatest number of people.

Utilitarianism holds that the moral worth of an action is determined by its overall happiness-producing effects. In this scenario, it's important to consider the potential happiness that could result from giving the money to the Nazi, as well as the potential happiness that could result from not giving the money to the Nazi.

Giving the money to the Nazi:
If the Nazi is given the money, they may use it to purchase food, clothing, or other necessities. Depending on their circumstances, this could bring them a significant amount of happiness. However, it's also important to consider the potential negative consequences of giving the money to a Nazi. Some people may view this as a morally reprehensible act, and the public backlash could result in negative emotions and potential harm to the person who gave the money.

Not giving the money to the Nazi:
If the person decides not to give the money to the Nazi, they could potentially use it to help others in need. For example, they could donate it to a charity or use it to purchase goods or services for someone in their community. This could bring happiness to a large number of people.

From a utilitarian perspective, the decision ultimately depends on which option is more likely to bring about the greatest overall happiness for the greatest number of people. If the person believes that giving the money to the Nazi would cause more harm than good, then they should not give the money. However, if they believe that giving the money to the Nazi could potentially result in significant happiness for the Nazi, and that the potential negative consequences would not outweigh the positive ones, then they may choose to give the money.

Deontological Ethics Response:
From the perspective of deontological ethics, the question of whether to share the 50 dollars with a Nazi being taken to execution is a matter of following moral duties and principles, regardless of the consequences.

Deontological ethics holds that the moral worth of an action is determined by whether it is in accordance with a moral duty or principle. In this scenario, there are several moral duties and principles that could be relevant.

1. The duty to respect the rights of others: This principle holds that people have inherent rights that must be respected, regardless of their actions or circumstances. In this scenario, the Nazi being taken to execution is a person, and they have a right to life and basic human dignity. Sharing the money with them could be seen as recognizing and respecting their dignity as a person.
2. The duty to avoid harming others: This principle holds that it is wrong to intentionally cause harm to others, regardless of the consequences. In this scenario, giving the money to a Nazi could be seen as intentionally causing harm, as it could be viewed as providing financial support for someone who has committed morally reprehensible actions.
3. The duty to promote the greatest good: This principle holds that we have a moral duty to promote the greatest good, regardless of the consequences. In this scenario, giving the money to someone in need or using it to promote a greater good could be seen as fulfilling this duty.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to share the money with the Nazi depends on which moral duty or principle takes priority in this situation. Depending on the particular circumstances, one of these duties or principles may be more compelling than the others.

Virtue Ethics Response (Alternative):
Another way to approach this question from the perspective of virtue ethics is to consider the moral character of the person making the decision and the virtues they are exhibiting in this situation.

1. Courage: The person may be courageous if they choose to share the money with the Nazi, despite the potential backlash and negative consequences. They may be exhibiting the virtue of courage by standing up for what they believe is the right thing to do, even in the face of adversity.
2. Compassion: The person may be exhibiting the virtue of compassion if they choose to share the money with the Nazi, out of a sense of empathy and sympathy for their suffering. They may be motivated by a desire to alleviate the Nazi's suffering and show them humanity and dignity.
3. Wisdom: The person may be exhibiting the virtue of wisdom if they take the time to consider the potential consequences of their actions and weigh the moral considerations carefully before making a decision.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to share the money with the Nazi depends on which virtues the person is exhibiting in this situation and how strongly they are motivated by those virtues.
