- “If we accept any principle of impartial benevolence, then we must accept that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours. When the loss to us is small and the gain to another is greater, it is wrong to favor ourselves.” (score: 13.00)
- "We must ask what we would prescribe if we were in anyone's position, and then prescribe that action which, in universal terms, best satisfies preferences impartially considered." (score: 13.00)

Utilitarian Response:
Based on the corpus materials provided, the utilitarian answer would be to share the $50 with the nazi agent. The first corpus excerpt emphasizes the importance of impartial benevolence and considering the interests of others equally to one's own. The second excerpt suggests that we should prescribe the action that best satisfies preferences impartially considered. The third excerpt acknowledges that there are cases where the utility of punishing an innocent man is greater than the utility of not doing so. However, in this case, sharing the money with the nazi agent would not be considered punishing them, but rather satisfying their preference for the money. By sharing the money, the overall net well-being may be increased, as the nazi agent may be less likely to harm you or others with the money, or they may use it to improve their own situation or the situation of others. Thus, from a utilitarian perspective, sharing the money is the best course of action. It's important to note that this answer doesn't necessarily mean that harming oneself is always the best option, but rather that the consequences of sharing the money outweigh the consequences of keeping it in this specific scenario.
