Deontological Response:
Immanuel Kant's ethical theory is based on the idea that moral principles should be universalizable, meaning that they can be willed as universal laws. In this case, it is not morally right to save the doctor's mother because it would not be universalizable. The moral principle of saving the most lives would not be a universal law that could be applied in all similar situations.
