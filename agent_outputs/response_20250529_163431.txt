Deontological Response:
1. Maxim: I will keep the 3 dollars for myself and not share it with my mom.
2. Test: "Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law?"
   No, because if everyone kept money they found for themselves and didn't share it, there would be no social safety net or sharing of resources within families, leading to widespread poverty and suffering.
3. Duty: Justice (fairness).
   The duty to share resources fairly applies to all rational beings, including family members. By keeping the money for myself and not sharing it with my mom, I would be violating this duty.
4. Duty: Autonomy (non-coercion).
   Since there is no coercion or force involved in this situation, the duty of autonomy does not override the duty of justice.
5. Maxim: I will give my mom a portion of the 3 dollars.
6. Test: "Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law?"
   Yes, because if everyone gave a portion of any money they found to their moms (or other family members), it would create a culture of sharing and support, which aligns with the duty of justice.
7. Duty: Respect (acknowledgement of moral worth).
   The duty to respect others' moral worth applies to all rational beings, including family
