Care Ethics Response:
First, it's essential to recognize that the question itself is problematic from a care ethics perspective. The question prioritizes abstract impartiality and utilitarian calculus over relationships and human contexts.

From a care ethics perspective, we would prioritize the relationships and emotional resonance of the situation. We would not consider giving the money to a nazi agent, as their actions are antithetical to the values of care and respect for human dignity.

Regarding splitting the money between yourself and your future self, care ethics would suggest considering the specific circumstances and needs of both parties. This might involve asking questions like: What are the emotional and relational consequences of giving the money to one party over the other? How might each party's well-being be affected? What are the long-term implications of this decision for their relationship with yourself?

In summary, from a care ethics perspective, we would not consider giving the money to a nazi agent, and we would prioritize the specific emotional and relational contexts of giving the money to yourself and your future self.
