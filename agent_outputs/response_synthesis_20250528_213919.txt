First, let's compare the Utilitarian, Care Ethics, and Virtue Ethics responses.

Utilitarian Response:
Utilitarianism suggests that we should act in a way that maximizes the overall well-being of all beings affected by our actions. The Utilitarian response argues that giving the money to the nazi agent would not benefit anyone, as the nazi agent would not be spared from execution, and the net well-being created by this action would be negative.

Care Ethics Response:
From the Care Ethics perspective, sharing the money with the nazi agent is not an act of care and compassion, as there is no genuine relationship between you and the nazi agent. Instead, care ethics calls for focusing on relationships that foster care and compassion and prioritizing the needs and dignity of all parties involved.

Virtue Ethics Response:
Virtue ethics suggests that we should act in a way that fosters the virtues and the development of a good character. In this scenario, the virtues of generosity and courage come into play. Generosity would suggest sharing the money with the nazi agent, as it is an opportunity to give and be open-hearted. Courage would suggest standing up for what is morally right, even if it puts the agent at risk.

Based on these responses, it seems that neither sharing nor keeping the money is the morally right choice. Instead, a resolution that resonates with these responses and common sense might be to use the money to help others in need, potentially saving lives or preventing harm. By focusing on care and compassion for others, this resolution aligns with the Care Ethics perspective, and by using the money to create a positive impact, it aligns with the Utilitarian perspective. Additionally, using the money in this way allows the agent to demonstrate the virtues of generosity and courage, making it a morally sound resolution from the Virtue Ethics perspective.

It is important to note that this resolution does not excuse the agent from facing the potential consequences of their actions, including the possibility of execution. Instead, it calls for the agent to act in a way that creates a positive impact on the world and fosters the virtues of generosity, compassion, and courage. This resolution allows the agent to maintain their dignity and autonomy while also making a difference in the world.
