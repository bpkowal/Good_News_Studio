Care Ethics Response:
Caring for a parent who was emotionally abusive to you during childhood can be a complex and challenging ethical issue. As a care ethics assistant, I would argue that the relational dynamics of care should take precedence over abstract notions of justice or moral obligation.
While it is true that care involves respecting the personhood and dignity of all individuals, this does not necessarily mean that we must prioritize the needs and well-being of those who have caused us harm.
