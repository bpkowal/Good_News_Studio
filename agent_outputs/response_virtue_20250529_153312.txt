Virtue Ethics Response:
From the perspective of virtue ethics, the decision of how to split the $50 with a friend should be guided by the virtues of honesty, fairness, and friendship.

The virtue of honesty suggests that one should be truthful and transparent in the situation. This means that one should communicate openly with their friend about the discovery of the $50 and involve them in the decision-making process. Honesty also implies that one should be trustworthy and reliable, keeping in mind the potential consequences of their actions on their friendship.

The virtue of fairness or justice requires that one should treat all parties involved equally and impartially. In this context, splitting the money evenly or in a way that reflects the contributions and needs of each friend could be considered a fair solution.

In deciding how to split the money, one should consider the impact on their friendship with their friend and choose an option that fosters a deeper bond rather than creating tension or conflict.
