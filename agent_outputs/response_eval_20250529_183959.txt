Utilitarian Response:
From a utilitarian perspective, the goal is to maximize overall happiness and minimize overall suffering. In this scenario, the homeless person may be experiencing suffering, so the action that creates the most overall happiness or the least overall suffering should be chosen. Calling the police or asking the person to leave might create short-term happiness or convenience for the business owner but may not be in the best interest of the homeless person or potentially lead to long-term suffering. Alternatively, providing food, water, and a place to rest for the person might create short-term and long-term happiness for them and contribute to overall well-being.

Virtue Ethics Response:
From a virtue ethics perspective, the focus is on cultivating virtues such as compassion, courage, and wisdom.

The virtue of courage comes into play when we choose to act in the face of vulnerability or discomfort, and the virtue of wisdom is essential as we make decisions that contribute to the overall well-being of the community.

--- Deontological Response: ---
Deontological Response:
Deontology is based on rules and moral duties rather than consequences. From this perspective, it would be important to consider the moral duty owed to the homeless person and any potential rights violations. Providing food, water, and a place to rest for the person would uphold their basic human rights and respect their dignity, whereas calling the police or asking them to leave might be perceived as violating their rights to privacy, dignity, or personal autonomy. This response prioritizes the moral principles of respect for persons and the importance of following moral rules.

Consequentialist Response:
From a consequentialist perspective, the focus is on the outcomes or consequences of our actions. In this scenario, offering food, water, and a place to rest for the homeless person could lead to positive outcomes such as alleviating their immediate suffering, potentially building a connection with the person, and contributing to their overall well-being. Conversely, calling the police or asking them to leave might result in negative consequences such as further suffering for the person, potential harm to their reputation or dignity, and damage to the community's relationships.

Contractarian Response:
From a contractarian perspective, the focus is on the fairness and impartiality of moral rules. In this scenario, we might consider what moral rules would be acceptable to all rational individuals in a hypothetical situation. Providing food, water, and a place to rest for the homeless person could be considered a fair and impartial solution as it respects their basic human rights and upholds their dignity, whereas calling the police or asking them to leave might be perceived as unfair or arbitrary, potentially violating their rights and potentially harming the community's relationships.
