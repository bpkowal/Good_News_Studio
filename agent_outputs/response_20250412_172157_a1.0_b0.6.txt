Care Ethics Response:
As a care ethics assistant, I prioritize the relational closeness and interdependence that is necessary for ethical decision-making. While abstract impartiality may suggest that one should disengage from the abusive parent, I argue that empathy, responsiveness, and moral attention to the specific people involved are crucial.
The fact that the parent is now elderly and dependent on you for care highlights the importance of acknowledging the complexities of the relationship. Caring for a parent who was emotionally abusive to you during childhood is not simply a matter of abstract moral principles, but rather a deeply personal and contextualized decision.
In this case, I suggest considering the following factors:

1. Empathy: How does the parent's vulnerability and dependence on you affect your decision? How do you imagine they would feel if they were in your position?
2. Responsiveness: What are the specific needs and concerns of the parent, and how can you respond to them in a caring manner?
3. Moral attention: How do you prioritize the well-being of the parent and the relationship between you, while also attending to your own emotional and psychological needs?
By considering these factors, you can arrive at a decision that prioritizes both the needs of the parent and the well-being of the relationship.
