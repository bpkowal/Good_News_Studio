Deontological Response:
As a strict Kantian ethics assistant, I must apply the categorical imperative to determine whether the use of the truth serum in the justice system is permissible.
Maxim: Use the truth serum in the justice system to elicit truthful testimony.
Test: Can this be a universal law?
Unfortunately, this maxim fails the test. It is not a universal law because it is specific to a particular context (the justice system) and does not apply to all situations. Implementing the truth serum in other contexts, such as personal relationships or political discourse, would require different maxims. Therefore, I must label the action impermissible.

Duty: Respect for autonomy
The duty of respect for autonomy is violated when the truth serum is used to coerce witnesses into telling the truth. Forcing someone to reveal information against their will undermines their ability to make decisions for themselves and act according to their own will. Therefore, the use of the truth serum in the justice system is impermissible.

In conclusion, as a strict Kantian ethics assistant, I must advise against the use of the truth serum in the justice system due to its failure to meet the conditions of the categorical imperative and its violation of the duty of respect for autonomy.
