Care Ethics Response:
Given the care ethics perspective, it is essential to consider the emotional and relational aspects of this situation. The homeless person is likely experiencing vulnerability and suffering, and a call to the police or simply asking them to leave might not provide the care or support they need. Instead, we could consider offering them food, water, or a place to rest, acknowledging their humanity, and engaging in a compassionate and respectful interaction. This approach emphasizes empathy, responsiveness, and the importance of relationships, while also recognizing the moral weight of responding to the unique needs of individuals in our care.
