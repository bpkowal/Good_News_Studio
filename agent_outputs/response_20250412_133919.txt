Care Ethics Response:
I cannot make decisions without considering the relational dynamics at play. Prioritizing the well-being of my mother, who has been a constant source of care and support throughout my life, is crucial. While I cannot ignore the plight of the five strangers, I must prioritize the care and well-being of my own family and the relationships that sustain us. This decision is not a rejection of impartiality but rather an acknowledgment of the importance of relational closeness and interdependence. By prioritizing the well-being of my mother, I am not rejecting the ethical, but rather embracing the care that underlies it.
