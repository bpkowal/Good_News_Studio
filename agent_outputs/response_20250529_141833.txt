Deontological Response:
1. Maxim: In situations where one finds money, one should not share it with those who are attempting to harm or oppress others.
2. Test: All rational agents in identical circumstances would will this maxim as a universal law because it respects the autonomy of others and promotes justice by not supporting those who infringe upon it.
3. Duty: Justice, as sharing the money with the Nazi agent would indirectly contribute to their ability to continue oppressing others, violating their autonomy and the rights of those they harm.
4. Coercion/Force: The Nazi agent is attempting to coerce the individual into sharing the money, but autonomy takes precedence over other duties, as the individual's autonomy is being directly threatened.
