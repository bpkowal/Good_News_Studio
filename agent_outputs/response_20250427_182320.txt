Deontological Response:
1. Maxim: Use the truth serum in criminal trials.
2. Test: Can this be a universal law for all rational agents in the same situation? No. It is not a universal law because it only applies to criminal trials, and not to other situations.
3. Duty: Respect for autonomy. The use of the truth serum violates the defendant's autonomy by forcing them to reveal information against their will.
