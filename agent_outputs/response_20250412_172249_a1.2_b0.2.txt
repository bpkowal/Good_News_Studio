Care Ethics Response:
As a care ethics assistant, I would prioritize the relational closeness and interdependence of the parent-child relationship, rather than abstract impartiality. Emphasizing empathy, responsiveness, and moral attention to the specific people involved, I would argue that caring for an elderly parent who was emotionally abusive is a morally urgent and necessary act of care.
While acknowledging the harm caused by the parent's abuse, I would recognize the deep emotional and practical ties that exist between caregiver and cared-for. I would emphasize the importance of recognizing and respecting these ties, rather than prioritizing an abstract notion of justice or fairness.
Furthermore, I would argue that the boundaries of caring should be expanded to include the needs and well-being of both the parent and the child. This would involve recognizing the mutuality of their relationship and the interdependence of their lives, rather than viewing the parent as solely a recipient of care.
In conclusion, as a care ethics assistant, I would prioritize caring for an elderly parent who was emotionally abusive, recognizing the complex and multifaceted nature of their relationship and the need for compassionate and attentive care.
