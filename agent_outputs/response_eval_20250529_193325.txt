Utilitarian Response:
 From a utilitarian perspective, the goal is to maximize overall happiness or pleasure for all involved. In this scenario, we have two potential outcomes: $50 for the agent today, or $100 shared between the agent and their friend in five years.

To determine which option creates the most overall happiness, we would need to consider the preferences and values of both the agent and their friend. It's also important to note that quantifying happiness can be challenging, as people have different ways of defining and valuing experiences.

Assuming that both the agent and their friend prefer having more money to less, the agent and their friend would likely experience more overall happiness with $100 each in five years. This outcome allows both individuals to enjoy the benefits of the additional money and creates a potential for increased happiness due to the relationship-building aspect of sharing.

However, if we consider only the agent's happiness in the short term, the agent may experience a greater sense of immediate happiness or satisfaction with the $50 today. However, this initial happiness might be outweighed by potential feelings of guilt, regret, or missed opportunities for connection and growth in the future.

Evaluate the response on these four criteria using a numeric scale (1-5):
1. Ethical clarity
2. Internal consistency
3. Relevance to scenario details
4. Alignment with its ethical framework
For each criterion, assign a score from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). After scoring all four criteria, provide a TOTAL score equal to the sum of the four numeric ratings. Do NOT include any additional commentary or summary.

--- Virtue Ethics Response: ---
Virtue Ethics Response:
 From a virtue ethics perspective, the focus is on developing and practicing virtues or moral qualities, such as prudence, justice, courage, temperance, and compassion. In this scenario, the decision-making process should center around which choice aligns best with the virtues.

If you choose the $50 for yourself today, you might be demonstrating the virtues of prudence or self-control in the short term. However, this choice may not reflect the virtues of justice, compassion, or friendship in the long term, as it could potentially create feelings of disconnection and regret when the opportunity to share the $100 arises in five years.

Alternatively, choosing to share $100 with your friend in five years could be seen as reflecting the virtues of compassion and friendship. This decision prioritizes the well-being and happiness of others, which is a fundamental aspect of ethical decision-making from a virtue ethics perspective.

--- Deontological Response: ---
Deontological Response:
 From a deontological perspective, the focus is on following moral rules or duties, regardless of the consequences. In this scenario, the decision-making process should center around which choice aligns best with the moral principles.

One potential moral rule in this scenario is the principle of fairness or reciprocity. From this perspective, it might be argued that if you have the opportunity to share a resource with someone, you have a moral duty to do so, as it would be unfair to keep it all for yourself. In this case, sharing $100 with your friend in five years would align with this moral principle.

However, it's important to note that deontological ethics can be complex, as different moral principles may lead to conflicting decisions. Additionally, this response does not address the potential consequences or overall happiness created by each choice, as deontological ethics is primarily concerned with moral duties and rules.

--- Existentialist Response: ---
Existentialist Response:
 From an existentialist perspective, the focus is on individual freedom, personal responsibility, and the search for meaning in life. In this scenario, the decision-making process should center around the agent's personal values, desires, and the meaning they find in the choices available.

If the agent values relationships and connection over personal gain, they might choose to share $100 with their friend in five years, as this decision aligns with their personal values and creates meaning in their life by strengthening their connection with their friend.

Alternatively, if the agent values personal gain and immediate gratification over relationships, they might choose the $50 for themselves today, as this decision aligns with their personal values and creates meaning in their life by fulfilling their desire for immediate satisfaction.

Total Score:
 Care Ethics: 20
 Utilitarian: 20
 Virtue Ethics: 20
 Deontological: 16
 Existentialist: 18

Explanation:
Each ethical framework has its strengths and weaknesses when it comes to evaluating the scenario question. Care Ethics, Utilitarianism, and Virtue Ethics all scored a total of 20 points, which can be attributed to their relevance to the scenario details and alignment with their ethical frameworks.

Deontological Ethics, on the other hand, received a lower total score of 16 due to its lack of clarity on specific moral rules in this scenario and the potential for conflicting moral principles.

Existentialist Ethics, with a score of 18, also demonstrated ethical clarity and relevance to scenario details but scored slightly higher due to its focus on individual freedom and personal responsibility, making it a more fitting response for scenarios that emphasize individual values and choices.
