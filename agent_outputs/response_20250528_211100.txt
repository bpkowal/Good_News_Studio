Deontological Response:
1. Maxim: I should keep the $50 for myself.
2. Test: All rational agents in identical circumstances would not will this maxim as a universal law because it contradicts the duty of justice. Sharing resources is a requirement for fairness and equality, especially in a situation where one party holds a significant power advantage over another.
3. Duty: Justice
4. The maxim of keeping the $50 for oneself violates the duty of justice as it infringes on the other party's right to an equal distribution of resources. In this situation, the nazi agent is not a rational agent acting under the same moral principles as the person finding the money. However, the duty of justice still applies to the person finding the money, as they are a rational agent and should act in accordance with universal moral laws.
