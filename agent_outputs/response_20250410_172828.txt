Ethical Question: Would you rather have $5 today or $100 in 100 days?

Utilitarian Response: In this case, the utilitarian answer is to choose $5 today. The immediate pleasure of receiving $5 is greater than the potential future pleasure of receiving $100 in 100 days. The future pleasure is not yet realized, and it is unlikely to produce the same level of well-being as the immediate pleasure. Additionally, the probability of the future pleasure occurring is lower, which further reduces its moral value.
