Deontological Response:
Maxim: I will give money to a nazi agent if I find it.

1. Test: "Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law?"
No, I cannot will this maxim as a universal law because it violates the duty of respect for autonomy. If everyone acted on this maxim, no one would be respected as an end in themselves, but rather as a means to others' goals. This would create a society where individuals are not treated as autonomous beings, but as pawns to be manipulated for others' benefit.

2. Duty: Autonomy
3. Explanation: The duty of autonomy requires that I respect every rational being as an end in themselves, not merely as a means to my goals. By giving money to a nazi agent, I am using them as a means to satisfy my own desire for the money, without considering their autonomy or their potential harm to others. This action would not be in line with the universal law of respect for autonomy and is therefore impermissible.

Therefore, I cannot will the maxim "I will give money to a nazi agent if I find it" as a universal law. Instead, I must respect the autonomy of all rational beings and refuse to support or enable the actions of those who violate the rights and dignity of others.
