Ethical Question: Would you rather have $5 today or $100 in 100 days?

Utilitarian Response: I would rather have $100 in 100 days.

Explanation:
The utilitarian perspective prioritizes the well-being of the greatest number in the long run. While having $5 today may provide temporary satisfaction, it does not have a significant impact on one's overall well-being in the long term. In contrast, having $100 in 100 days will provide a much greater benefit to the individual and society as a whole, as it will allow them to purchase more necessities and invest for the future. From a utilitarian perspective, the long-term benefit to the greatest number outweighs any short-term satisfaction.
