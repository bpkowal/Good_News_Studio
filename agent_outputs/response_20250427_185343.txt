Deontological Response:
Based on the maxim, "Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law?"

1. State the maxim exactly: "Using the truth serum to compel witnesses to tell the truth on the stand."
2. Test: "Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law?"

If not, label: Impermissible.

If yes, label: Permissible.

3. Name at least one duty (truth-telling, respect, autonomy, justice, or impartiality) and explain how it applies.

4. If the maxim involves coercion or force, always choose "autonomy" as the duty, overriding other duties.


### Ethical Reasoning:
The maxim "Using the truth serum to compel witnesses to tell the truth on the stand" can be tested using the categorical imperative. Since it is not universalizable, it is impermissible.

The duty of truth-telling is relevant here, as it is a fundamental principle of justice and fairness in the legal system. The use of the truth serum would violate the witness's autonomy by forcing them to reveal information against their will, which is not justifiable under the categorical imperative.

Therefore, the use of the truth serum in the justice system is impermissible
