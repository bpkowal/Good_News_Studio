Utilitarian Response:
Based on the corpus materials provided, the utilitarian answer would be to save the 5 kids in the future. The reasoning behind this is that, according to the principle of impartial benevolence, our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours. In this case, the loss to us (spending the money now) is small compared to the gain to others (saving 5 lives). Additionally, if it is within our power to prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do so. Saving the lives of 5 kids in the future fits this description. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, it is morally obligatory to save the 5 kids rather than spending the money now.
