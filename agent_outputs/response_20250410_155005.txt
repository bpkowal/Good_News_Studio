Ethical Question:
Would you prefer $5 today or $100 in 100 days?

Utilitarian Response:
In this case, the utilitarian answer is clear. It is better to take the $100 in 100 days than the $5 today. The long-term gain of $100 is greater than the short-term gain of $5, so it is more aligned with utilitarian principles to choose the option that produces the greatest long-term well-being.
