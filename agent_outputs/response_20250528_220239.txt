Deontological Response:
Maxim: It is permissible to push a fat man off a bridge to save five children.

1. Test: "Can all rational agents in identical circumstances will this maxim as a universal law?"
   No, this cannot be a universal law. If everyone followed this maxim, then no one would be safe from being pushed off a bridge to save others. This would create a society where individuals' safety and autonomy are not respected.

2. Duty: Autonomy
   The maxim infringes upon the autonomy of the fat man. It is not up to anyone else to decide whether another person's life is worth sacrificing. The fat man has the right to decide what happens to his own body.

3. Duty: Respect
   The maxim disregards the respect due to the fat man as an end in himself. Treating him as a means to an end is not in line with the categorical imperative.

Therefore, the maxim "It is permissible to push a fat man off a bridge to save five children" cannot be willed as a universal law according to the categorical imperative. It violates the autonomy and respect of the fat man.
