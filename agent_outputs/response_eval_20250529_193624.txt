Virtue Ethics Response:
 According to virtue ethics, the focus should be on developing good character, which enables us to flourish and lead fulfilling lives. The virtues of wisdom, courage, justice, and compassion guide our moral decision-making process.

In this scenario, the choice depends on which virtue aligns best with the situation. The virtue of compassion might be the most relevant virtue as it emphasizes empathy and caring for others. By choosing to share $100 with a friend in five years, you demonstrate compassion and care for the well-being of another.

Moreover, waiting to share the money does not detract from your ability to flourish or live a fulfilling life. In fact, it could even enhance your character as you demonstrate self-control and patience in delaying personal gratification for the sake of a friend.

--- Deontological Response: ---
Deontological Response:
 From a deontological perspective, moral obligations are determined by specific rules or duties. Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative is a common deontological ethical framework. It suggests that we should act in a way that we could will for everyone to follow without exception.

In this scenario, the question revolves around whether to choose $50 for oneself today or $100 to share with a friend in five years. Applying Kant's categorical imperative, it is essential to consider whether we could will that everyone follows our chosen action without exception.

If we choose to keep $50 for ourselves, we cannot will that everyone follows this action. The consequence would lead to widespread selfishness and a lack of concern for others' well-being. Instead, if we choose to share $100 with a friend, everyone could theoretically follow this action, as it promotes caring for others and maintaining social connections.

--- Consequentialist Response: ---
Consequentialist Response:
 Consequentialism is an ethical theory that focuses on the consequences of an action to determine its moral worth. In this scenario, the ethical decision depends on which action leads to the greatest net positive consequence.

One approach to consequentialist reasoning would be to calculate the overall happiness derived from each option. In the present, if we choose $50 for ourselves, we may experience short-term happiness. However, the happiness derived might be outweighed by the potential long-term dissatisfaction of not sharing the $100 with our friend. On the other hand, sharing the $100 with our friend in five years could result in both our happiness, as well as theirs.

Another approach to consequentialist reasoning would be to consider the potential impact on future relationships and the well-being of others. Choosing to share the money with our friend might strengthen the bond between you, potentially leading to positive consequences in the long run.
