Virtue Ethics Response:
From the perspective of virtue ethics, the question at hand is not primarily about rules or abstract principles, but about the development of moral character and virtues. The virtues that come into play in this situation are generosity, compassion, and self-control.

Quote 1: "Virtue is a state of character concerned with the performance of morally good actions." (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 2.6)

The first quote from Aristotle emphasizes that virtue is a matter of character. In this situation, our decision to share or keep the money reflects the state of our moral character. If we choose to share, we are demonstrating generosity and compassion. If we choose to keep it, we may be demonstrating self-interest or a lack of concern for others.

Quote 2: "We become just by performing just actions, temperate by performing temperate actions, brave by performing brave ones." (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 2.7)

This quote from Aristotle highlights the importance of habituation in the development of virtue. By making a habit of sharing or giving to others in need, we are cultivating the virtue of generosity. Likewise, by practicing self-control and refraining from taking what isn't ours, we are cultivating the virtue of temperance.
