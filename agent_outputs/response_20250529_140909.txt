Deontological Response:
1. Maxim: I can will to have the x-ray vision procedure done for myself, disregarding the fact that it is not reversible.
2. Test: All rational agents in identical circumstances cannot universally will this maxim as a law. If everyone acted upon this maxim, then there would be no limit to the number of people seeking the procedure for themselves, leading to a society where the majority have x-ray vision and the minority do not, violating the duty of impartiality.
3. Duty: Impartiality. The principle of impartiality requires that we treat all rational beings equally, without favoritism or discrimination. By seeking the procedure for myself, I would be favoring myself over others, creating an unequal society.
4. Autonomy does not apply here, as the procedure involves a violation of another's rights (their sight) and does not involve coercion or force.
