Deontological Response:
In this situation, the duty of respect for the autonomy of the individual must take precedence over the duty to tell the truth. The use of the serum would be impermissible because it would violate the autonomy of the individual by forcing them to act against their own will.

### Justification:
The maxim "use the serum to make witnesses tell the truth on the stand" can only be willed as a universal law if all rational agents in the same situation were to be forced to use it. However, this maxim is not universally applicable because not all rational agents would be willing to have their autonomy violated in this way. Therefore, the action of using the serum is impermissible.
