Care Ethics Response:
This question presents a significant moral dilemma, but from the perspective of care ethics, the answer would prioritize relationships and emotional resonance over abstract impartiality. 

First, we would acknowledge that caring involves being engrossed in another's reality and feeling with them. In this case, the relationship with the nazi agent is one of hate, violence, and oppression. The nazi agent represents an ideology that goes against the foundational values of care ethics, including respect for all human beings, empathy, and nonviolence.

Second, we would recognize that some relationships carry more moral weight than others. Given the harm and suffering that the nazi ideology has caused, the relationship with the nazi agent holds significantly less moral weight than relationships with those who promote care, compassion, and human dignity.

Lastly, we would not feel guilty for not caring equally for all. Instead, we would acknowledge that the appropriate boundaries of caring expand only as far as our ability to empathize and respond effectively. In this case, the boundaries of caring do not extend to a nazi agent.

Therefore, from a care ethics perspective, the $50 should not be split with the nazi agent. Instead, the money could be used to support organizations or individuals who embody the values of care ethics and promote human dignity and compassion.
