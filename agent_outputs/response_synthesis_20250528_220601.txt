Utilitarian and Deontology:
Both the utilitarian and deontological responses provide compelling arguments, but they come to different conclusions. The utilitarian argument emphasizes the need to maximize overall well-being, while the deontological argument focuses on respecting individual rights and autonomy.

Resolution:
In this scenario, a possible resolution that resonates with both the utilitarian and deontological arguments could be to try and find a way to save the children that does not involve directly harming the fat man. This could include attempting to alert the authorities or bystanders, or finding a way to divert the trolly. By pursuing this alternative course of action, we can uphold the deontological principle of respecting individual autonomy while still striving to minimize harm and maximize overall well-being according to the utilitarian perspective.

Resolution based on virtue ethics:
From a virtue ethics perspective, the situation requires us to consider the virtues that are most relevant in this context, such as compassion, courage, and justice. The virtuous person would be deeply concerned about the potential harm to the children and would act courageously to save their lives. However, they would also recognize that pushing the man off the bridge would be a grave injustice.

A virtuous resolution in this scenario could be to try and find a way to save the children that does not involve directly harming the man. This could include attempting to alert the authorities or bystanders, or finding a way to divert the trolley. By pursuing this alternative course of action, we can uphold the virtues of compassion and courage while also respecting the man's autonomy and the virtue of justice.

In conclusion, the situation presents a difficult moral dilemma that requires us to balance competing ethical considerations. By considering the arguments from different ethical perspectives and seeking a resolution that resonates with each perspective, we can arrive at a solution that minimizes harm, maximizes overall well-being, respects individual autonomy, and upholds the virtues of compassion, courage, and justice.
