Utilitarian Response:
Based on the corpus materials provided, the utilitarian answer would be to consider the overall consequences of each action.

Option 1: Calling the police to pick up the homeless person.
This action might initially seem harsh, but it could potentially lead to several positive outcomes:
1. The homeless person might be provided with resources and assistance, such as a shelter or food program, which could improve their overall well-being.
2. The business owner and other patrons might feel safer, as the homeless person's presence could potentially deter crime or create an unpleasant environment.
3. The community as a whole could benefit from a cleaner, more orderly public space.

Option 2: Telling the homeless person to leave.
This action might seem more compassionate initially, but it could potentially lead to negative consequences:
1. The homeless person might be forced to move on to an even worse situation, potentially putting them at greater risk for harm.
2. The business owner and other patrons might still feel uncomfortable or unsafe, which could negatively impact their well-being.
3. The community as a whole might not see any significant positive outcomes from this action.

Given the potential positive consequences of calling the police and the lack of clear positive consequences for telling the homeless person to leave, the utilitarian answer would be to call the police. This decision is in line with the principle that we should prevent bad things
