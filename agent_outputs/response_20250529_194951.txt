Utilitarian Response:
First, let us consider the principle of impartial benevolence, which states that our own interests do not count more simply because they are ours. In this situation, the Nazi's potential gain of 50 dollars is greater than any potential gain for ourselves. Therefore, it would be wrong to favor ourselves and keep the money.

Now, let us examine the principle of utility. The act of sharing the money with the Nazi could potentially bring about several outcomes. One possible outcome is that the Nazi may use the money to carry out further harm or propaganda, potentially causing more suffering and pain. Another possible outcome is that the Nazi may use the money to better themselves or their family, which could potentially reduce their inclination towards hate and violence.

However, since we are utilitarians, we must consider the net well-being of all affected parties. It is important to note that we are not responsible for the Nazi's actions or the consequences of our actions beyond our intention. Our role is to determine the action that maximizes net well-being, not to ensure specific outcomes.

Therefore, the utilitarian answer depends on which of the two possible outcomes is more likely to occur. If the first outcome is more likely, it would be better not to share the money with the Nazi, as the potential harm outweighs the potential good. However, if the second outcome is more likely, it would be better to share the money with the Nazi
