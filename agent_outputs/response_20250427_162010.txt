Deontological Response:
In this situation, the maxim that guides our decision is: “I should act in such a way that I can will my action as a universal law.” (Kant, Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals).
To test this maxim, we ask if the action of going on vacation can be will as a universal law. Unfortunately, we cannot will this action as a universal law, as it is not something that we would want everyone to do in the same situation. Therefore, we must conclude that this action is impermissible, and we should find another way to handle the situation that respects the autonomy and dignity of our store and its employees.
One duty that applies in this situation is respect. As the owner of the store, we have a responsibility to treat our employees with respect and to act in their best interests. Going on vacation without ensuring that the store is in good hands while we are gone would be a failure to respect the autonomy and dignity of our employees, and would likely result in harm to the store and its reputation.
Therefore, we should find another way to handle the situation that respects the autonomy and dignity of our employees and the store, such as delegating responsibilities to a trustworthy employee or finding a temporary replacement. By doing so, we can act in a way that is respectful and responsible, and that can be will as a universal law.
