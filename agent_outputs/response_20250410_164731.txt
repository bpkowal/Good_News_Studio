Ethical Question: Would you rather have $5 today or $100 in 100 days?

Utilitarian Response: In this case, I would choose to have $5 today. The consequences of this action are more immediate and directly benefit me, providing me with a tangible sum of money that I can use to improve my well-being immediately. From a utilitarian perspective, this action produces a net increase in total well-being, as I am able to directly improve my own life in the short term. While the alternative option of receiving $100 in 100 days may produce a larger net increase in well-being in the long term, the consequences of this action are more distant and less directly beneficial to me. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, I choose to accept the immediate reward of $5 today.
