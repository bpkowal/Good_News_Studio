Utilitarian Response:
I understand that this is a difficult decision, but I must prioritize the well-being of the greatest number. In this case, saving the lives of five strangers would maximize net well-being, as they have more lives to live and contribute to society.

I cannot assume that my personal feelings or intuition are more important than the greater good.
