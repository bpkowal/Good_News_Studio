“It is not profitable for us at present to do moral philosophy... until we have an adequate philosophy of psychology, for we are bound to operate with a conception of the soul, or the psyche, or human nature.”

This quote articulates Anscombe's challenge to post-Enlightenment moral systems and her call for a return to virtue as a psychological and philosophical category, not a rule set.
