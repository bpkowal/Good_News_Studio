“To know who I am is a species of knowing where I stand. My identity is defined by the commitments and identifications which provide the frame or horizon within which I can try to determine from case to case what is good.”

Taylor’s work places virtue within the broader arc of personal narrative, suggesting that character and morality emerge from one's interpretive horizon and lived story.
