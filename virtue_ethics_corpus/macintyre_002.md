“The mean is discovered not in isolation but within the practices and traditions of a community; what counts as courageous or temperate can shift, but always aims for the flourishing of the whole.”

Virtue is shaped by social practices—prudence, or *phronesis*, is attuned to the living wisdom of a community as well as the individual.
