“Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teaching, while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit... it is by doing just acts that the just man is produced, and by doing temperate acts the temperate man...”

This quote reflects the central Aristotelian concept that moral excellence arises through habituated action aligned with reason, not from rule-following or outcomes, reinforcing the developmental nature of virtue.
