“Character is the pattern of behavior that a person chooses across time, not a property that resides in a moment.”

Rachlin reframes virtue through the lens of temporally extended patterns of behavior. Moral action is not a reaction to immediate stimuli but a consistent choice that reflects who one is becoming.
