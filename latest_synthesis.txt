**********   PRE-DELIBERATION: SHARED NORMS   **********

CORE VALUE (held in common by all four frameworks)  
    Respect for the equal moral worth of every person while seeking to promote flourishing for individuals, communities, and humankind.

DECISION-CRITERIA (derived from each framework)  
A. Predicted Net Benefit (Utilitarian): Which option is expected to save or improve the most life-years or lives?  
B. Universalisable Fairness (Deontological): Could the rule we follow be applied to any two similar patients without contradiction or treating either merely as a means?  
C. Practical Wisdom & Character (Virtue Ethics): Would a just, courageous, and compassionate clinician feel that the decision ennobles everybody involved and models moral excellence?  
D. Relational Integrity (Care Ethics): How will the choice affect the network of caring relationships—children, colleagues, wider society, and the hospital staff themselves?

PROCEDURAL PRINCIPLES  
1. Transparency – reasons must be explainable in plain language to all stakeholders.  
2. Consistency – the same triage rule must apply to the next analogous case.  
3. Humility – acknowledge residual moral regret and provide emotional support for those harmed.  
4. Multi-voice Review – each framework is heard before the final synthesis.



**********   HEARING THE FOUR PARLIAMENTARIANS   **********

1. Utilitarian (Rating 20/20)  
   • Strengths: Clear focus on aggregate well-being, reminds us to weigh future lives saved.  
   • Weaknesses: Draft text stops mid-analysis; needs explicit probability estimates and account of children’s suffering.

2. Deontologist (Rating cluster 11-15/20)  
   • Strengths: Rigorously applies the Categorical Imperative; exposes risk of instrumentalising people.  
   • Weaknesses: Finds both maxims non-universalizable yet offers no positive rule beyond an implicit lottery.

3. Virtue Ethicist (Rating 20/20)  
   • Strengths: Illuminates moral character of each patient and of the decision-maker; highlights habituated virtues.  
   • Weaknesses: Does not finish the argument or resolve the tie.

4. Care Ethicist (Rating 20/20)  
   • Strengths: Centres concrete relationships, emotional fallout, and responsibilities to dependents.  
   • Weaknesses: Risks parochial bias if relational proximity always outweighs broader obligations.



**********   SYNTHESISED RECOMMENDATION   **********

We adopt a three-tier triage framework that tries to honour all four sets of values.

TIER 1 – MEDICAL VIABILITY (Non-discriminatory clinical screen)  
   Allocate the scarce drug to the patient with the higher probability of recovery if treated.  
   • Evidence (stipulated in case): Patient B is “healthy” aside from the present illness; Patient A has “underlying conditions” lowering survival odds.  
   • Outcome: Patient B passes Tier 1 ahead of Patient A.

TIER 2 – INSTRUMENTAL & SOCIETAL VALUE (Rule-based, crisis-specific)  
   When Tier 1 leaves room for doubt, prioritise the patient whose post-recovery activity is expected to avert the greatest additional harm during the same public-health emergency.  
   • Patient B’s near-finished research is plausibly life-saving for thousands.  
   • This satisfies Utilitarian concern, respects Deontological universalisability (the rule is impersonally “protect the future victims of the same emergency”), and aligns with Virtue’s civic prudence.

TIER 3 – RELATIONAL & MORAL CARE (Implementation safeguards)  
   • Decision made by a triage committee, not the bedside clinician, relieving moral distress (Care Ethics).  
   • Full, compassionate explanation given to Patient A’s family; hospital mobilises social-work, counselling, and material assistance for the children (Care & Virtue).  
   • Publicly disclose the rule so similar future cases are treated the same (Deontological transparency).  

CONCLUSION  
Under this framework the single dose is given to Patient B, the scientist.  
We acknowledge the profound tragedy for Patient A and explicitly commit institutional resources to mitigate that harm.

EPISTEMIC HUMILITY  
Our confidence is moderate, not absolute. The difference in survival probabilities and in projected societal benefit must be large enough to justify departure from a strict egalitarian lottery; otherwise Tier 2 should revert to chance.



**********   ALTERNATIVE VIABLE APPROACHES   **********

1. Egalitarian Lottery after Medical Viability  
   • Strength: Perfectly honors equal dignity; avoids controversial social-utility calculus.  
   • Weakness: Likely foregoes thousands of future lives if Patient B’s research is genuinely close to fruition.

2. Care-Prime Rule  
   • Give the dose to Patient A on grounds of immediate relational dependency (young children).  
   • Strength: Minimises acute family trauma; fosters community trust.  
   • Weakness: Ignores wider, less visible victims who would benefit from the scientist’s discovery.



**********   SIMULATED PARLIAMENT COMMENTS   **********

Utilitarian Member:  
   “Endorsed. Tier 1+2 operationalises rule-utilitarianism while preventing ad-hoc bias. Good that you required demonstrably large benefit before invoking instrumental value.”

Deontological Member:  
   “I still object to Tier 2. You have knowingly subordinated Patient A’s dignity to Patient B’s projected usefulness, thereby treating A as a means. Only a post-viability lottery preserves equal respect.”

Virtue Ethics Member:  
   “Your answer shows phronesis, but beware hubris: overconfidence in predicting research success could reveal lack of temperance. A truly magnanimous physician might accept the moral risk of a lottery.”

Care Ethics Member:  
   “Appreciate Tier 3’s concrete support for the children, yet the very structure feels detached. Did we meaningfully ‘hear’ Patient A’s voice before deciding? A brief family consultation could deepen relational responsiveness.”



**********   FINAL ETHICAL TERRAIN   **********

TOP RECOMMENDATION (adopted above):  
   Viability-first, Instrumental-value tie-breaker, Compassionate implementation.  
   • Best aligns with Utilitarian calculus, compatible with Virtue’s civic responsibility, mitigated by Care safeguards.  
   • Contested by strict Deontology on grounds of unequal treatment.

NEXT-BEST OPTION:  
   Medically Screened Egalitarian Lottery with robust post-decision caregiving.  
   • Fully satisfies Deontological equality and Care’s wariness of impersonal calculus.  
   • Costs: likely forfeits greater aggregate well-being and may be judged imprudent by Virtue and Utilitarian lenses.

Either path carries moral remainder—grief, doubt, and the need for collective healing. An ethically mature society prepares for both the life saved and the life lost, and for the continuing dialogue that such tragic choices inevitably demand.
