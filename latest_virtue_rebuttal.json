  "ethical_question": "an employee who discovers fraudulent activities in their company. If they disclose this information, they remain truthful but might violate their loyalty to the company and colleagues (real-world example of whistleblowing)",
  "utilitarian_response": "Based on the utilitarian principles outlined in the corpus materials, the employee's decision to disclose the fraudulent activities should be evaluated based on the overall consequences. The first principle of impartial benevolence suggests that the employee's personal interests, including their loyalty to the company and colleagues, should not be prioritized over the greater good.\n\nIn this case, allowing the fraudulent activities to continue would result in harm to the company and potentially its stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, and even employees. On the other hand, disclosing the information would prevent further harm and potentially lead to positive outcomes, such as the company taking corrective measures and restoring trust with its stakeholders.\n\nThe second principle from the corpus materials emphasizes that when the numbers are extreme, intuitions must yield. In this context, the potential harm caused by the fraudulent activities likely outweighs any harm the employee might experience by disclosing the information.\n\nAdditionally, the third principle from the corpus materials warns against compromising the trust in the judicial system, which could lead to more harm than good. By reporting the fraudulent activities, the employee contributes to maintaining the integrity of the company's judicial system and upholding trust.\n\nTherefore, according to utilitarian principles, the employee should disclose the fraudulent activities to maximize overall well-being.",
  "virtue_ethics_rebuttal": "The utilitarian response to the ethical dilemma of a whistleblowing employee focuses primarily on the overall consequences of the actions, disregarding the role of virtues in the decision-making process. While the utilitarian perspective may lead to the \"greater good\" in the given scenario, it does not necessarily promote virtuous dispositions or support practical wisdom (phronesis) in the context of ethical decision-making.\n\nFirstly, the employee's loyalty to their colleagues and the company is considered an obstacle to be overcome rather than a virtue to be considered. The utilitarian response suggests that the employee should disregard their loyalty to prioritize the greater good, potentially damaging trust and relationships within the organization. In contrast, virtue ethics emphasizes the importance of cultivating virtues such as loyalty, honesty, and integrity, and the role they play in human flourishing.\n\nSecondly, the utilitarian response does not account for the development of practical wisdom (phronesis) in the employee. The employee is not encouraged to consider the context and nuances of the situation, nor to reflect on the potential long-term consequences of their actions. Instead, the utilitarian approach relies on a rigid and impersonal evaluation of consequences, which may not provide the employee with the opportunity to grow and develop as an ethical decision-maker.\n\nLastly, the utilitarian response does not ensure that individuals and communities will flourish over time. While disclosing the fraudulent activities might lead to short-term positive consequences, it may also result in long-term negative consequences, such as damaging the employee's reputation, creating a hostile work environment, or even putting the employee at risk. A virtue ethics approach would encourage the employee to consider the long-term impact on their character and the well-being of their community, and to strive for actions that promote human flourishing in all aspects.\n\nIn conclusion, the utilitarian response to the whistleblowing dilemma may lead to the \"greater good\" in the given scenario but does not promote virtuous dispositions, support practical wisdom, or ensure the long-term flourishing of individuals and communities. Virtue ethics, on the other hand, encourages decision-making that fosters virtues, supports practical wisdom, and contributes to human flourishing."
