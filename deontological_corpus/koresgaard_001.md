“When you act for reasons, you act under the idea that your principles are fit to be laws.”

Korsgaard grounds duty in the **autonomous will**: morality is binding because we legislate it to ourselves. Actions are right if they stem from principles we could rationally endorse for all—**not because of outcomes, but because they express our identity as rational agents**.
