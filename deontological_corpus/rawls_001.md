“Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override.”

Rawls argues that **justice is prior to utility**. His theory of **justice as fairness** defends individual rights through hypothetical agreement in the **original position**, establishing duties and liberties that are not negotiable, even for the sake of greater social outcomes.
