“To act autonomously, then, is to act according to laws that we give to ourselves — but laws that we could not rationally reject. That is the source of their authority: not external compulsion, but our own reason.”

This quote captures the modern Kantian emphasis on **moral autonomy** and **the self-legislation of duty**. Korsgaard frames obligation not as obedience to external rule, but as a rational necessity tied to agency itself. It's a cornerstone of contemporary deontological ethics, particularly useful for comparing universalism vs. relativism in machine models.
