“Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.”

This quote expresses the categorical imperative: a principle is only moral if it can be universalized. Lying is wrong not because of its outcomes but because it violates a duty to truth, undermining the trust necessary for moral law to exist at all.
