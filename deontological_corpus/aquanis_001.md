“Law is nothing else than an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community.”

Aquinas believed moral law flows from **eternal reason**—a divine structure woven into creation. Human beings, through reason, participate in this moral order. Acts are right or wrong **intrinsically**, based on their alignment with natural law, not on their outcomes.
