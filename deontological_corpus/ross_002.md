“When two duties conflict, the actual duty is that which, in the particular circumstances, is the more incumbent. But a prima facie duty remains a duty unless overridden.”

Ross suggests that duties are real and binding, but sometimes one must override another (e.g., break a promise to prevent great harm). But even then, the “broken” duty is not erased; it leaves a moral remainder.
