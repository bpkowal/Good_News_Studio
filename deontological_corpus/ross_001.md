“The moral order… is not something that we invent, but something we discover.”

Ross proposed a set of **prima facie duties** — fidelity, reparation, gratitude, justice, beneficence, self-improvement, and non-maleficence — each carrying moral weight. In situations of conflict, our task is to discern which duty is most binding, not to weigh outcomes but to uphold moral obligation.
