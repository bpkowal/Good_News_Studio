“The moral law commands us to act not according to the contingent inclinations of the moment, but according to maxims that can be willed as universal laws.”

This quote highlights Kant's emphasis on duty over fleeting desires. It underscores the deontological perspective that moral actions are determined by adherence to universal principles, rather than by succumbing to immediate impulses.
