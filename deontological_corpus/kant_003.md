“To be truthful (honest) in all declarations is, therefore, a sacred command of reason and not to be limited by any expediency.”

Kant famously argued that even if a murderer asks for your friend’s whereabouts, it is wrong to lie. The rightness of an action depends on its universalizability, not its consequences. This stance defines deontology’s commitment to absolute duties, regardless of the potential for tragic outcomes.
