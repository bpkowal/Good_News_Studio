“Just as the destruction of the group cannot be a legitimate purpose of war, so it cannot be a legitimate practice in war.”  [oai_citation_attribution:0‡Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2007/walzer-terrorism-just-war?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

This quote emphasizes the deontological principle that civilians and noncombatant groups must never be treated merely as means to an end in armed conflict, reinforcing the moral duty of noncombatant immunity.
