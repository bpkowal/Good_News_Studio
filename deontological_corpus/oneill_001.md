“To treat someone as an end is to treat them as a bearer of obligations and rights, not merely as a means to our goals.”

O’Neill emphasizes that moral reasoning begins by recognizing others as autonomous agents. **Duties** arise not from consequences but from the **inherent worth** of persons. This view resists manipulation, even for well-intended outcomes.
