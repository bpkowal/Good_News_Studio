“The natural law is nothing other than the rational creature’s participation in the eternal law.”

Aquinas holds that human reason allows us to discern right from wrong, reflecting a deeper order established by divine reason. Morality is grounded not in arbitrary rules, but in the rational structure of reality itself.
