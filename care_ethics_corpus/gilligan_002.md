Gilligan describes the ethic of care as grounded in attentiveness and responsiveness, emphasizing its contextual and psychological dimensions.

> "Caring requires paying attention, seeing, listening, responding with respect. Its logic is contextual, psychological. Care is a relational ethic, grounded in a premise of interdependence. But it is not selfless."
