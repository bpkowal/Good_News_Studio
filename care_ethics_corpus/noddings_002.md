Noddings distinguishes between natural caring and ethical caring, emphasizing that ethical caring arises from a commitment to act in a caring way, even when one does not naturally feel inclined to do so.

> "When one intentionally rejects the impulse to care and deliberately turns her back on the ethical, she is evil, and this evil cannot be redeemed."
