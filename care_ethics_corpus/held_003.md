Held expands the concept of autonomy in care ethics to account for mutual decision-making and the importance of negotiating space and time within relationships.

> "Mutual autonomy is different from individual autonomy. It includes mutual understandings and acceptances of how much sharing of time, space, daily decisions, and so on there will be, and how much independently arrived at activity."
