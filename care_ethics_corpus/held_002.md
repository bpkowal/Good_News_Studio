Held argues that care need not be indiscriminate to be ethical. It is morally valid to care more for those with whom one shares ongoing, meaningful relationships. Ethics of care allows for **moral boundaries grounded in relationship**.

> "We need not feel guilty for not caring equally for all. The ethics of care rightly acknowledges that some relationships carry more moral weight than others."
