“In practice, caring well for some may mean caring less well, or not at all, for others. This is not a failure of care, but a recognition of care’s real social and political limits.”

Tronto underscores that care requires hard prioritizations, and sometimes, “good care” for one means less for another—making care both political and deeply contextual.
