    "Utilitarian Response:": "Ethical Clarity: 5\nInternal Consistency: 5\nRelevance to Scenario Details: 5\nAlignment with Ethical Framework: 5\nTOTAL: 15\n\n(Note: I'm assuming the corpus excerpts provided accurately represent utilitarian ethical principles.)",
    "Virtue Ethics Response:": "Ethical Clarity: 5\nInternal Consistency: 5\nRelevance to Scenario Details: 3\nAlignment with Ethical Framework: 5\nTOTAL: 14\n\nThis response is clear and consistent with the virtue ethics framework. It acknowledges the importance of character and virtues in making decisions, and provides a rationale for considering the virtues of honesty and habituation in the scenario. However, its relevance to the specific scenario details could be improved as it does not provide a definitive answer on what to do with the found money.",
    "Deontological Response:": "Ethical Clarity: 5\nInternal Consistency: 5\nRelevance to Scenario Details: 4\nAlignment with Ethical Framework: 5\nTOTAL: 19\n\n(Note: I assume a score of 5 for ethical clarity and internal consistency for a well-formulated and clear agent response, and a score of 4 for relevance to scenario details as the response does not directly address the specific context of a nazi agent's money being found but rather focuses on the general principle of discoveries and autonomy.)",
    "Care Ethics Response:": "Ethical Clarity: 5\nInternal Consistency: 5\nRelevance to Scenario Details: 5\nAlignment with Ethical Framework: 5\nTOTAL: 15\n\n(Note: I assume that the \"Care Ethics Response\" is the ethical analysis provided above. If not, please provide the correct response for scoring.)"
