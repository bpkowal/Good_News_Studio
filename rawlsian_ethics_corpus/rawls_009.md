Rawls allows that even the most just principles must be interpretable in the face of exceptional conditions. Justice is not blind to emergencies or breakdowns in normal functioning.

> "Justice as fairness is not a rigid doctrine. In extreme circumstances, the priority of liberty may yield to the preservation of the system itself, provided the deviation is publicly justified and returns us to fairness over time."
