Rawls introduces public reason as a way for citizens in a pluralistic society to justify political principles based on shared reasons acceptable to all.

> "Our exercise of political power is proper only when we sincerely believe that the reasons we offer for our political advocacy are sufficient, and we also reasonably think that other citizens might also reasonably accept those reasons."
