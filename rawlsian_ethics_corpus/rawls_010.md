Rawls distinguishes between ideal theory, which assumes a well-ordered society under favorable conditions, and nonideal theory, which guides action under injustice or constraint.

> "Ideal theory provides a target and framework, but it is nonideal theory that tells us how to move toward it under the conditions of injustice and hardship that characterize the real world."
