Rawls aligns his theory of justice with a Kantian tradition, emphasizing autonomy and the moral law individuals would choose under fair conditions. Yet he adapts it into a political conception, grounded in democratic legitimacy.

> "The conception of justice as fairness is a political, not metaphysical, conception... but its roots lie in the Kantian idea that persons are free and equal moral agents, capable of self-legislation under principles they could accept in a fair original position."
