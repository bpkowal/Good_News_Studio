Rawls criticizes utilitarianism for allowing the interests of the few to be sacrificed for the greater good. His conception of justice prioritizes the inviolability of individuals and fairness over aggregate welfare.

> "Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override. For this reason, justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others."
