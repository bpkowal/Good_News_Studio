Rawls proposes that principles of justice should be chosen behind a veil of ignorance, where individuals do not know their place in society, to ensure fairness and equal rights.

> "Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. The principles of justice are chosen behind a veil of ignorance to ensure impartiality."
