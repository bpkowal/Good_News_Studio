Rawls argues that justice must be blind to factors outside an individual’s control, including arbitrary timing of birth or life events, emphasizing fairness across time.

> "The arbitrariness of the temporal position of persons in society — their being born earlier or later — is not a basis for treating them differently in the basic structure of institutions."
