Rawls presents the original position as a device of representation. By imagining ourselves behind a veil of ignorance, we are better positioned to select principles of justice that are fair to all.

> "The original position is not a reflection of how things are, but a purely hypothetical situation designed to lead to a certain conception of justice. The veil of ignorance removes bias and ensures impartiality."
